00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:12.610
Logan Pearce (she/her): Cool, all right. So Hi, you know me. I'm. Logan Pierce. I have a astronomy, astrophysics, Phd. Candidate, and so I spend

2
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.760
Logan Pearce (she/her): a lot of my time reading and writing

3
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.990
Logan Pearce (she/her): research into journal articles for publication. So

4
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.800
Logan Pearce (she/her): this for this workshop I wanted to just talk about how I

5
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.770
Logan Pearce (she/her): approach, keeping up with new research in my field, and then digesting

6
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.120
that new research quickly.

7
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.490
Logan Pearce (she/her): because

8
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:51.680
Logan Pearce (she/her): it can feel overwhelming, especially if you're trying to get into a new field or like a new subfield or something where you're not already kind of familiar with the literature. And so

9
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.950
Logan Pearce (she/her): I wanted to talk about how I do that, because it can feel overwhelming like, I said.

10
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.280
Logan Pearce (she/her): Because if you read, you know, if you start at the beginning and you read to the end, you're never going to finish. It's just it's way. Too much

11
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.540
Logan Pearce (she/her): information. It's a way too many words. It's way, too many pages you will

12
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:23.620
Logan Pearce (she/her): quickly drown so. But you don't have to read. You don't have to read to the end. So So that's what I was going to talk about was just about what I do.

13
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:31.090
Logan Pearce (she/her): and then just have a conversation as we go along. So ask questions whatever.

14
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.700
Logan Pearce (she/her): What's this chat?

15
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.630
Logan Pearce (she/her): J: You said you were looking to digest some neuroscience literature?

16
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.610
Jay Farris: Yeah. So my i'm kind of behind the times and like.

17
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.150
Jay Farris: So like performance, psychology is cool. It's really in this

18
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.280
Jay Farris: niche field.

19
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.410
Jay Farris: Is that performance like like fit like sports performance. It's a sports psychology.

20
00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.860
Jay Farris: It's.

21
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.530
Jay Farris: But I don't know if it's quite up to date. Now, everything's going to neuroscience.

22
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.669
Jay Farris: You know a lot of. You know, the cognitive psychology and neuroscience are kind of merging.

23
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:22.310
Jay Farris: And so I, you know, I really like neuroscience. But one thing you know. with, you know, because essentially like, perform the psychology. It's your coach right?

24
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.520
Logan Pearce (she/her): But

25
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.970
Jay Farris: easy.

26
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.600
Logan Pearce (she/her): No problem.

27
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.930
Jay Farris: Okay. But

28
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.440
Jay Farris: sorry.

29
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.330
Logan Pearce (she/her): No worries.

30
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.930
Jay Farris: Yeah. To coach to a subfield

31
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:57.740
Jay Farris: like a military or athletes. I feel being able to explain. The neuroscience behind things would make it much more easier for them to understand versus

32
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:05.770
Jay Farris: kind of woo psychology stuff. Yeah, for sure. That's that's what i'm looking to do. And so I don't have a

33
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.390
Jay Farris: I have a background. It's a medic, so I can learn a lot of anatomy and physiology pretty fast.

34
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:18.090
Jay Farris: you know, but I don't have, like the chemistry and all that. I think I can pick it up pretty fast.

35
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.240
Jay Farris: you know, without having to like. Go through a whole undergrad program again. But

36
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.090
Jay Farris: that's what I like to do.

37
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:33.320
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah, and also keeping up with the latest developments in a field like

38
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.930
Logan Pearce (she/her): even if I

39
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:54.460
Logan Pearce (she/her): like. So before we started recording, I was talking with J. About how I recently started a project that's in a slightly different sub discipline than what I'm used to. So I wasn't familiar with the history and all the literature, the current state of the art for this field, so I had, like

40
00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:08.420
Logan Pearce (she/her): tons of literature I had to digest to try to get up to speed into what's the current state of the art in this sub sub discipline. and so I had a huge amount to to try to. Hey, Katarina.

41
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.190
Logan Pearce (she/her): to try to digest. And

42
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.329
Logan Pearce (she/her): so now I've I've gotten over that hurdle, and I'm pretty much up to speed now. But

43
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:32.520
Logan Pearce (she/her): papers come out every day, so I still have to stay on top of what's the latest in that field. you know, if I read an a pivotal paper from 2,008, that's great like that's pivotal in the field. But

44
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:41.930
Logan Pearce (she/her): a lot has happened since 2,008, so like what builds on on that work and keeps going, and every single day there's new papers that come out.

45
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.520
Logan Pearce (she/her): So staying on top of even latest developments, once you get up to speed is very important.

46
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.190
Logan Pearce (she/her): So let me see.

47
00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:05.440
Jay Farris: So how did you determine what? What paper? So you're diving into this new field, Was it recommendations? And then you just kind of went out rabbit holes, or how did you determine what you were going to read.

48
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:17.100
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah, that's a great question. So a lot of that. I cover a lot of the tools that help me do that in the research tools, paper, or workshop a couple of weeks ago. But

49
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.730
Logan Pearce (she/her): so I just started like with a basic literature search.

50
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:29.770
Logan Pearce (she/her): However. different fields have different tools for searching literature. My field has something called NASA astrophysical data system or ads.

51
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:40.730
Logan Pearce (she/her): A a broad tool is Google Cloud. Google Scholar is another broad tool for doing that. It's maybe not the best, but it's it. It works for all fields.

52
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.130
So I just like started with a keyword search.

53
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:55.590
Logan Pearce (she/her): and that got me to some papers as like a starting point, especially some of the pivotal papers you could even do. I even did like a Google just straight up Google search, and that will return our journal articles also.

54
00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:01.950
Logan Pearce (she/her): And so I started. I found a few like pivotal papers, and then let me

55
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.550
Logan Pearce (she/her): let me share my screen.

56
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.680
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah.

57
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.940
Logan Pearce (she/her): So hold on

58
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.630
Logan Pearce (she/her): share my screen.

59
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.880
Logan Pearce (she/her): So so this

60
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.350
Logan Pearce (she/her): China

61
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:37.280
Logan Pearce (she/her): manage. Zoom: okay. So this is NASA astrophysical data system. This is how in astronomy we deal with journal journal articles.

62
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.870
Logan Pearce (she/her): So

63
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.860
Logan Pearce (she/her): the field I was jumping into is white Dwarfs White dwarfs are

64
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.870
basically the core of dead stars after they've

65
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.060
Logan Pearce (she/her): involved. And died, our son will eventually be away to her.

66
00:06:50.220 --> 00:07:02.460
Logan Pearce (she/her): So I was looking specifically for polluted white doors, which are white doors that have metal in their atmospheres, whatever. It's not doesn't matter, but the key word is polluted white doors. So if you know, I just put it in an abstract.

67
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.480
Logan Pearce (she/her): and this will give me

68
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:14.580
Logan Pearce (she/her): things sorted by year. So this is 2,023. So this is the most recent stuff

69
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:23.040
Logan Pearce (she/her): which is maybe not not not going to get me to pivotal papers. But I did then I could do like a just a clean on Google search

70
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.830
Jay Farris: so

71
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:32.540
Jay Farris: quick question on on that, too. So if you're looking, and i'm sure if I go back and

72
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:38.090
Jay Farris: look at your other class, the answer will be there, but

73
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:46.260
Jay Farris: it would you also kind of sort it by like. How often that paper is cited to get an idea of Okay.

74
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.590
Jay Farris: Yeah. So that's what I was gonna.

75
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.890
Jay Farris: Yes, Google Solar will do that, too.

76
00:07:52.960 --> 00:08:00.280
Logan Pearce (she/her): So this is a paper I'm very familiar with now. It's one of the pivotal papers coaster at all, 2,014,

77
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.130
Logan Pearce (she/her): so

78
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:06.940
Logan Pearce (she/her): I can actually look at it on NASA ads. It's very nice. Everything's connected.

79
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.950
Logan Pearce (she/her): and

80
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:22.620
Logan Pearce (she/her): if there one member decides to load, there it is, and it has all the citations of these papers. So this is so. Here's the abstract. This is the summary of the paper.

81
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.920
Logan Pearce (she/her): and then it has citations over here, and it has

82
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:30.040
Logan Pearce (she/her): every paper that has ever cited this paper, which

83
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:36.140
Logan Pearce (she/her): is what 25 times through 13. That's a lot. This is a really pivotal paper.

84
00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:41.840
Logan Pearce (she/her): and should have it on Google Google Scholar, too.

85
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.500
Logan Pearce (she/her): that should have citations.

86
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.030
Logan Pearce (she/her): Let me put in

87
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:52.540
Logan Pearce (she/her): It's Oops.

88
00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.450
Logan Pearce (she/her): It's title

89
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.340
Logan Pearce (she/her): into Google Scholar.

90
00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.310
Logan Pearce (she/her): There it is.

91
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:06.710
Oh.

92
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:12.950
Logan Pearce (she/her): and oh, it just took me to that to the

93
00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:14.420
Journal's website.

94
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:26.430
Logan Pearce (she/her): Oh, here we go, cited by. So this has. So here it has. You can save it to your profile. So if I want to save this paper, I can save it. If I want to get the citation for this paper here it is in lots of formats.

95
00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:35.270
Logan Pearce (she/her): and if I want to see the articles that have cited this paper, they have it here. This is all the ones that have cited this paper.

96
00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:42.720
Logan Pearce (she/her): which is a ton. has related articles. I'm. Not familiar with that, but that's a good.

97
00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.050
Logan Pearce (she/her): That's a good way to go.

98
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:52.740
Logan Pearce (she/her): But there's another tool that I talked about in the other workshop. That's also very helpful.

99
00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:56.660
Logan Pearce (she/her): something called connected papers.

100
00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.050
Logan Pearce (she/her): This is super cool.

101
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.640
Logan Pearce (she/her): so i'll put that title on there.

102
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.830
There it is

103
00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:08.680
Logan Pearce (she/her): coaster at all. 2,014,

104
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.760
and then it will generate this graph.

105
00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.630
Logan Pearce (she/her): So

106
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.880
Logan Pearce (she/her): this is a plot of

107
00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.650
papers that connect to this paper.

108
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:44.540
Logan Pearce (she/her): So that is that is like awesome, that is so cool. So here's the paper that I picked, and then I can see

109
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:53.290
Logan Pearce (she/her): this nodal network of all of these other papers. and like how they connect to this paper and like

110
00:10:54.310 --> 00:11:07.970
Logan Pearce (she/her): like this one is this: One is connected through this one. So coaster, 2,014 goes to Zuckerman. 2,010 goes to client 22,009 right? So it's not even direct. It's like there's some. There's a jump in the nodes.

111
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.960
Logan Pearce (she/her): So this is a this is a huge tool

112
00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:17.350
Logan Pearce (she/her): for getting a picture of everything that

113
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:23.430
Logan Pearce (she/her): connects to this paper in any way. There's also

114
00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:29.130
Logan Pearce (she/her): you can. So if you lie, if you create an account, you can save this paper.

115
00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.580
Logan Pearce (she/her): you can read the

116
00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:45.370
Logan Pearce (she/her): the abstract and title of so like. If I want to look at Zuckerman, 2,013 metal lines and white lists, so I can. I can see the title. I can see the author. I can see the abstract, and I can see if this is

117
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:46.920
Logan Pearce (she/her): a relevant

118
00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:53.430
Logan Pearce (she/her): paper or not. Maybe it's not exactly what I want. Maybe it's exactly what I want, and so I can save it.

119
00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.260
Logan Pearce (she/her): And then I think I can make it.

120
00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:04.720
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah, I can. Then I can just make a graph to. So I just clicked on Zuckerman 2,003 open graph. And now it's making a graph for that paper.

121
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.440
Logan Pearce (she/her): So you can see how that paper goes.

122
00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.080
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah. So there's that. Come in 2,003, and you can see

123
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.000
Logan Pearce (she/her): how

124
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:21.840
Logan Pearce (she/her): how other papers are connected to Zucker in 2,003,

125
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:28.590
Jay Farris: that that's really neat. So you could like to see all the ideas how it just like

126
00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:31.180
Jay Farris: in one thing that is awesome.

127
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.760
Logan Pearce (she/her): It's really great.

128
00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:34.230
This is

129
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.820
Logan Pearce (she/her): Hi, Rosalind!

130
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:37.750
Roslyn Grizzard: Hey, there!

131
00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:42.610
Logan Pearce (she/her): This is a really powerful tool just for getting like

132
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:50.590
Logan Pearce (she/her): figuring out how the state of the field and how things connect to other things, and to really get get your

133
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:57.390
Logan Pearce (she/her): citations for a literature review like figured out. Yeah.

134
00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.120
Logan Pearce (she/her): So okay.

135
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.850
So

136
00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:09.110
once you find a paper that you want to read.

137
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.660
Logan Pearce (she/her): Well, let me start. So

138
00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:16.740
Logan Pearce (she/her): this this kind of papers is giving me a picture of

139
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.430
Logan Pearce (she/her): papers. Then how in the field, or that I might want to read.

140
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.600
Logan Pearce (she/her): it. For

141
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:26.860
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah.

142
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:35.120
Logan Pearce (she/her): but to to stay on top of current papers. I'll show you what I do for that.

143
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:36.420
Logan Pearce (she/her): So

144
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:43.100
Logan Pearce (she/her): my field has something called archive pre pre pre-print, server

145
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:54.270
Logan Pearce (she/her): archive is for the physical sciences, but all fields pretty much are going to have some kind of pre print service. So you're gonna have to figure out what that is for your field.

146
00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:00.910
Logan Pearce (she/her): And so, like I think you are, you shared a pre-print server

147
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.640
Logan Pearce (she/her): from your field last time, right.

148
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:11.030
fioravanti: I don't think so. Maybe I did. But I don't think so.

149
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.120
Jay Farris: Yeah, Jay.

150
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:20.560
Jay Farris: what's what is the pre-print so what our pre-print is is

151
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:30.210
Logan Pearce (she/her): when when a paper. Is. Authors have papers that are just accepted to a journal, but Haven't necessarily been published yet.

152
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:36.620
Logan Pearce (she/her): They will publish the pre-print server in my case it's archive, and so

153
00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:42.520
Logan Pearce (she/her): it's a way to it's like a service that tracks all the latest

154
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:44.620
Logan Pearce (she/her): research every day.

155
00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:46.260
Logan Pearce (she/her): So.

156
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:54.900
Logan Pearce (she/her): for example, under astrophysics, my field Earth and planetary astrophysics. That's one of the ones that I care about. So if I click on that.

157
00:14:55.060 --> 00:15:01.030
Logan Pearce (she/her): here are all of the new papers for Monday. March twentieth they there.

158
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:03.390
Logan Pearce (she/her): There's 6 1.

159
00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.570
Logan Pearce (she/her): Here's the new papers for Friday.

160
00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:16.000
Logan Pearce (she/her): Here's the new papers for a Thursday, so it's it's up to the authors to publish to archive. In our case it's not like a scraper or anything.

161
00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:21.210
Logan Pearce (she/her): But this is how you can stay on top of the latest

162
00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:33.090
Logan Pearce (she/her): papers in all the fields in whatever field you care about. So I care about earth and planetary astrophysics. I also care about solar and stellar astrophysics.

163
00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.630
Logan Pearce (she/her): So what I did is signed up for archive

164
00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:41.630
Logan Pearce (she/her): pre-print server since a daily digest email.

165
00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:43.670
Logan Pearce (she/her): So every day

166
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:59.920
Logan Pearce (she/her): I get an email in my inbox which is right here from the preparate Server archive, and for all of the new planetary on this astrophysics and stellar astrophysics. So planets and stars in in that have been posted to archive before.

167
00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:04.830
Logan Pearce (she/her): So I get this email list, and every day, and it has title, author.

168
00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.100
Logan Pearce (she/her): abstract.

169
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:20.990
Logan Pearce (she/her): And so every day in the first let's look at the first thing I do is I scan this email, digest and read all the titles, and, like, I skim the titles and the authors usually to see if there anything that i'm interested in.

170
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:25.210
Logan Pearce (she/her): So I don't really care about this one. I'm not interested in that.

171
00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.260
Logan Pearce (she/her): Not really interested in that.

172
00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:39.920
Logan Pearce (she/her): I also look at the authors because I want to see if any of my colleagues, or someone who's working familiar with has has produced something not really to that. No.

173
00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.040
Logan Pearce (she/her): there was one today. I was interested in what was it?

174
00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:53.690
Logan Pearce (she/her): Oh, right. It was this one a creating white dress. But I don't want to use that one as an example.

175
00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:58.500
Logan Pearce (she/her): Okay, so let's say

176
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.460
Logan Pearce (she/her): I saw some of my collaborators had one. Where was it?

177
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:22.740
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah. So let's say that i'm interested in this one predicting the yield of small transition class whatever whatever. I know these 2 people, and so i'm like, oh, maybe I want to see what they what they did. So then i'll usually read the abstract. If I find a title, or a or authors that are interesting, then i'll, i'll skim the abstract.

178
00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:24.839
Logan Pearce (she/her): Are you familiar? What abstracts are

179
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:46.630
Logan Pearce (she/her): just to. I'll just define it really fast. So the abstract is just like a little paragraph summary of everything in the paper. So it should begin with Big picture. What field are we trying to address? And it should end with the conclusions that this paper came to, and then in the middle is how they did it.

180
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:52.410
Logan Pearce (she/her): So the whole. This is a basically one paragraph summary that should tell you everything in the

181
00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:53.670
Logan Pearce (she/her): in the article.

182
00:17:53.950 --> 00:18:06.980
Logan Pearce (she/her): So after I decide that I have. This is a potentially interesting paper. I will skim the abstract. I'll usually read, maybe the first sentence, and maybe the second, maybe the last minutes or the last few sentences, just to see what they found.

183
00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:13.570
Logan Pearce (she/her): And if I then decide that this, hey, this actually is a really interesting paper, then i'll open up the paper.

184
00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:18.750
Logan Pearce (she/her): So this is just the abstract again.

185
00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.710
Logan Pearce (she/her): So here's the favor

186
00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:29.270
Logan Pearce (she/her): it's taken Apparently this is a long paper. It's it's taking a while to load.

187
00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.860
I didn't really this, and take this on to it.

188
00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:00.770
Hey, go! I found it. Jay.

189
00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.080
Logan Pearce (she/her): There's your sec

190
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:08.120
Logan Pearce (she/her): neuroscience, pre-print service.

191
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:12.710
Logan Pearce (she/her): sci archive

192
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:18.480
Logan Pearce (she/her): So this is gonna work very similar to the one that I was showing you.

193
00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.410
Logan Pearce (she/her): So there you go.

194
00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:25.860
Jay Farris: Thank you.

195
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:26.850
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah.

196
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:29.740
Logan Pearce (she/her): And it's still loading.

197
00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.980
Logan Pearce (she/her): This is a really big paper.

198
00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:37.010
Jay Farris: not a good one to pick.

199
00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.920
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah, no. Our kind of is free

200
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:43.700
Logan Pearce (she/her): and connect the papers is for you also

201
00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:47.750
Logan Pearce (she/her): another thing with

202
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:52.070
Logan Pearce (she/her): Well, I don't actually, maybe I was connected papers.

203
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:54.780
Logan Pearce (she/her): Hmm.

204
00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:57.500
And

205
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.850
Logan Pearce (she/her): But yeah, so I just literally googled neuroscience pre-print and since here

206
00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:10.740
Logan Pearce (she/her): Oh, my God, it's still loading. I guess I picked a huge paper see if I can find something smaller.

207
00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.360
Logan Pearce (she/her): Okay, all right.

208
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:41.220
Logan Pearce (she/her): here is now. So now here's the paper, and this actually says, because this is a pre print it's not published yet.

209
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:49.010
Logan Pearce (she/her): it says, pre-print up here. It doesn't have publication details because it hasn't been published yet.

210
00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.390
Logan Pearce (she/her): and it says it's archive people over here.

211
00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:53.950
Okay. So

212
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:58.320
Logan Pearce (she/her): now i'll. At this point i'll usually scan the abstract again.

213
00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:03.310
Logan Pearce (she/her): and then I might sort of skim the introduction.

214
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.080
especially if i'm not super familiar with the the field.

215
00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:14.580
Logan Pearce (she/her): I i'll usually skim. This can skim the introduction

216
00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:19.360
Logan Pearce (she/her): towards the end of the introduction is where they start, they usually start to talk about what they did.

217
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:23.680
Logan Pearce (she/her): The introduction that basically just gives you like

218
00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:27.260
Logan Pearce (she/her): the current state of the field, and then how

219
00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:35.160
Logan Pearce (she/her): their work fits into the current state of the field and solve some problems, or is addressing some some question in the field.

220
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:43.780
Logan Pearce (she/her): so i'll often get to like the last paragraph of introduction. and then I skip usually to the conclusion.

221
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:56.340
Logan Pearce (she/her): maybe the discussion usually straight to the conclusion. So then the conclusion says what they found. so

222
00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.190
Logan Pearce (she/her): that is often as much as I will do for a general article.

223
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:06.920
Logan Pearce (she/her): If it's extremely relevant to what I

224
00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:11.020
Logan Pearce (she/her): i'm interested in, then i'll death. Then i'll start looking at figures.

225
00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:13.470
Logan Pearce (she/her): I will

226
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:18.700
Logan Pearce (she/her): scan through the figures. See if there's anything that looks interesting

227
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:25.570
Logan Pearce (she/her): and read the figure captions. One tip

228
00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:38.400
Logan Pearce (she/her): that I don't see being done in this figure caption. But one of the things that I always try to do when I write a figure caption is, I describe what the figure says, and then I say what the reader should take away from the figure.

229
00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.980
Logan Pearce (she/her): so i'll say like this is a plot of x versus y.

230
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:49.600
Logan Pearce (she/her): We can see from this plot that blah blah blah blah blah like what's the conclusion you need the reader to take away.

231
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:54.580
Logan Pearce (she/her): and I think that really helps, because the reader is not reading your paper from top to bottom.

232
00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.770
And so, having the conclusion, telling them what to think

233
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.330
Logan Pearce (she/her): about what you're showing them is vital.

234
00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:03.850
Logan Pearce (she/her): This paper did not do that.

235
00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.150
Logan Pearce (she/her): Just looking at this caption

236
00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:10.770
they found a typo.

237
00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:20.750
Logan Pearce (she/her): So yeah. So then i'll start reading the the figures and the captions see if there are any that are particularly

238
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:33.840
Logan Pearce (she/her): not worthy. And then I might start to read the discussion. because that's where they talk about in detail what their findings

239
00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:41.510
Logan Pearce (she/her): it's fine. and our and how it relates to the the science question that they're trying to address.

240
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:46.550
Logan Pearce (she/her): And then, if it's really something i'm interested in, like if it's somebody's

241
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:52.770
what one of my colleagues or somebody doing the same kind of work i'm doing. Then i'll read the methods

242
00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:55.320
Logan Pearce (she/her): last.

243
00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.820
Logan Pearce (she/her): Usually I don't read much of the methods.

244
00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:06.520
Logan Pearce (she/her): But yeah, so that's how I approach trying to quickly digest work.

245
00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:09.630
New latest work in the field

246
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.390
Logan Pearce (she/her): and

247
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:20.330
Logan Pearce (she/her): read a paper by skimming the most important parts first

248
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.510
Logan Pearce (she/her): parts some of the introduction to conclusion.

249
00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.200
Logan Pearce (she/her): then figures, tables.

250
00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.930
Logan Pearce (she/her): then maybe methods last.

251
00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:45.860
Jay Farris: Hey, Logan, do you when you do this? If it's something cool to you, then do you like kinda like, write a note or something for your own self, or do you? Just

252
00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:49.180
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah. So

253
00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:05.590
Logan Pearce (she/her): yeah, that's a great question. So if it's really something relevant, or i'm really trying to like, get up to speed on the state of a a field.

254
00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.370
Logan Pearce (she/her): I definitely will take notes. So

255
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:13.910
Logan Pearce (she/her): I showed this a little bit in the

256
00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:18.640
Logan Pearce (she/her): the research tools workshop.

257
00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:25.690
Logan Pearce (she/her): but one of my favorite tools is called Zotero, and watching it. It's it's starting up

258
00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:30.630
Logan Pearce (she/her): because it was closed on my computer.

259
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:33.940
Logan Pearce (she/her): And

260
00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:39.630
Logan Pearce (she/her): so taro basically is a library management system. So it's

261
00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.070
Logan Pearce (she/her): downloads and

262
00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:45.320
Logan Pearce (she/her): it downloads a copy of papers.

263
00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:46.850
Logan Pearce (she/her): including

264
00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.620
Logan Pearce (she/her): It's still starting up because it was closed.

265
00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:55.860
Logan Pearce (she/her): There we go.

266
00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.730
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah. so it

267
00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:06.020
Logan Pearce (she/her): you can. You see it?

268
00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:12.990
Logan Pearce (she/her): No, it Doesn't: Look right. It's

269
00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.240
Logan Pearce (she/her): what happened.

270
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:23.490
Sure.

271
00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:28.010
Logan Pearce (she/her): Okay, You see it?

272
00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:39.150
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah. Okay. So this is a zotero. So this is like all of the papers that I This is my personal library. This is all the papers that I have collected for any reason.

273
00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:44.450
Logan Pearce (she/her): and so Tarot has a

274
00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:48.130
Logan Pearce (she/her): browser connector. So

275
00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:55.160
Logan Pearce (she/her): if i'm interested in saving a paper, I just click the button, and it automatically saves the paper to my library.

276
00:26:55.890 --> 00:27:04.240
Logan Pearce (she/her): and it saves a local copy of the paper so you can actually. so I highlight a bunch of stuff.

277
00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:10.040
Logan Pearce (she/her): anything that seems relevant. I highlight I you can annotate.

278
00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:17.260
Logan Pearce (she/her): There's like a like a note button so you can add notes. So that's one of the things that I do.

279
00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:23.520
Logan Pearce (she/her): And another thing I do so also has a

280
00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.830
Logan Pearce (she/her): app, an ipad app.

281
00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:28.160
Logan Pearce (she/her): So I use

282
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.400
Logan Pearce (she/her): You see, if I can show my ipad.

283
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:32.310
I think I can do this.

284
00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:46.700
Logan Pearce (she/her): Okay, I've done it for

285
00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:04.170
Logan Pearce (she/her): There we go. Oh, my God here. so has an ipad app also

286
00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:05.500
that

287
00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:09.360
Logan Pearce (she/her): you can that sync with my

288
00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:15.030
Logan Pearce (she/her): desktop so, or safe with all my devices, so I can

289
00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.570
Logan Pearce (she/her): see

290
00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:22.920
Logan Pearce (she/her): those papers, and then I can mark it up.

291
00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:32.830
Logan Pearce (she/her): I can draw on it highlight things, draw on it, make notes, etc., which is really cool, and then it syncs with my

292
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.470
Logan Pearce (she/her): devices, so I can see my notes on my computer.

293
00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:43.420
Jay Farris: This is it syncs across Ios to

294
00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.010
Jay Farris: Microsoft

295
00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:47.820
Logan Pearce (she/her): to the zotero, app

296
00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:54.950
Jay Farris: to the so it doesn't like. So it's cool like if I have a like my laptop.

297
00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:58.590
Jay Farris: and then I have my ipad to different operate. Okay, cool.

298
00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:04.080
Logan Pearce (she/her): That's exactly what I do so earlier. I was showing it on my zotero on my laptop.

299
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:05.330
Logan Pearce (she/her): and

300
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:11.210
Logan Pearce (she/her): now it's on my ipad, and it's also on the cloud, so you can log in from any device and see your library.

301
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:18.750
Logan Pearce (she/her): and then another app that I use is good notes. This is my

302
00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:30.830
Logan Pearce (she/her): So here are my notes. No, this is not it. This is not the one I want. This is the one I want. So this is my notes where I take notes on papers that I was trying to learn when I was trying to learn all about white doors.

303
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:36.150
Logan Pearce (she/her): So I love using this because I can

304
00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:39.790
Logan Pearce (she/her): screenshot. So this is the

305
00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:49.890
Logan Pearce (she/her): in the map and the Mac ecosystem. I can screenshot a figure, and I can air drop it to my ipad, and then I can draw all over it on good notes.

306
00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:53.200
Logan Pearce (she/her): and I have it broken out by

307
00:29:53.230 --> 00:30:00.400
Logan Pearce (she/her): author. So this is I'll also at all 2010, the title, and then I kept.

308
00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:12.890
Logan Pearce (she/her): These are the figures that I thought were really important, and why, and I drew on them and highlighted them. wrote on them. Whatever I thought was important, and why. what matters

309
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:23.240
Logan Pearce (she/her): so? This is how I take notes on important papers that I need to remember for the future. And then it also has an outline. So if I go to the outline.

310
00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:32.950
Logan Pearce (she/her): I outlined all of my papers, so I can easily find if I need to read about devast and secrets in 2,012 or 2.

311
00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:36.410
Logan Pearce (she/her): This is my notes on that paper.

312
00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:48.710
Logan Pearce (she/her): So this is just something that I do myself, instead of like a physical notebook. I really really like using this good notes, because I can screenshot

313
00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:54.040
Logan Pearce (she/her): things from the paper and paste them into my notes and draw on them and stuff.

314
00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.790
Jay Farris: So the handwriting is going into your ipad.

315
00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:03.750
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah. So I have an apple pencil. Yeah, apple conflicts going in there. Okay, cool. And then I can just right on it

316
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:06.840
Logan Pearce (she/her): and draw on it with my pencil.

317
00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.960
Jay Farris: Nice? Yeah.

318
00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:12.940
Logan Pearce (she/her): And this is just instead of a

319
00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:17.900
Logan Pearce (she/her): paid like a paper notebook, I used a paper notebook forever until I got

320
00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:19.550
Logan Pearce (she/her): this ipad. And

321
00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:26.840
Jay Farris: now this looks really cool to it looks. You know better than some of the other, not taking stuff, but I've I can never

322
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:31.320
Logan Pearce (she/her): about one of the cool things about good notes. Is it actually can search your handwriting?

323
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:33.090
Jay Farris: Oh, wow!

324
00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:36.080
Logan Pearce (she/her): So you can actually use a search feature. So if I

325
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:39.190
Jay Farris: Hmm, it's like good luck with my handwriting.

326
00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:42.710
Logan Pearce (she/her): Stability

327
00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:48.500
Logan Pearce (she/her): stability. It finds it in my handwriting.

328
00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.210
Logan Pearce (she/her): Got it?

329
00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:58.680
Logan Pearce (she/her): So that's a. That's a cool thing about good notes. Other people use

330
00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:04.290
Logan Pearce (she/her): notability. Does something similar. Notion does something similar

331
00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:08.010
Logan Pearce (she/her): on notes. Microsoft Onenote.

332
00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:10.970
Logan Pearce (she/her): These are all similar things.

333
00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:19.860
Logan Pearce (she/her): I even bought a planner for good notes. I had to pay for it. Good notes is free, but the planner I paid for

334
00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:21.970
Logan Pearce (she/her): which is cool.

335
00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:26.340
Logan Pearce (she/her): This is My, this is my notes, my planner, and it connects to my

336
00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:30.660
Logan Pearce (she/her): my Google Calendar. So if I wanna

337
00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.370
Logan Pearce (she/her): add something to my Google Calendar, it connects automatically.

338
00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:37.670
Logan Pearce (she/her): Oh, yeah.

339
00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:42.160
Jay Farris: yeah, that's that's awesome.

340
00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:50.230
Logan Pearce (she/her): But because that was always my my one gripe about Google Calendar was. I couldn't draw on it. I wanted to like be able to write on it

341
00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:55.000
Logan Pearce (she/her): almost almost

342
00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:59.240
Logan Pearce (she/her): perfectly solved the problem. It's not a 100% perfect. It's real close.

343
00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.430
Jay Farris: that is so cool.

344
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:03.380
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah. So

345
00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:04.890
Logan Pearce (she/her): anyway.

346
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:12.310
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah, so I use good notes for that. and I love it. and i'm really happy with it.

347
00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.300
Logan Pearce (she/her): So

348
00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:23.530
Logan Pearce (she/her): yeah, that's kinda all

349
00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.650
Logan Pearce (she/her): I have to say about that.

350
00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.760
Logan Pearce (she/her): Do you all have

351
00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:36.650
Logan Pearce (she/her): question Slots comments. I mean, the main takeaway is don't even try to read it from beginning to end.

352
00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:42.250
Logan Pearce (she/her): Just read the important stuff, and only if

353
00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:45.250
Logan Pearce (she/her): the title or the authors sounds relevant.

354
00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:53.040
Jay Farris: So so when you are looking into the you know, when you're diving into this new field.

355
00:33:53.130 --> 00:34:01.540
Jay Farris: How long did it kind of take you to to do that? And then how many papers did you feel? You know how how many papers before you kind of felt

356
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:02.720
Jay Farris: immersed

357
00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.040
Jay Farris: and comfortable, just curious.

358
00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:17.580
Logan Pearce (she/her): There was a ton of papers in the polluted white door. Field was. There was so many another thing that I did to help myself wrap my mind around. It was I started writing my own little literature review.

359
00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:27.699
Logan Pearce (she/her): Once I, when I learned stuff, and I started to get wrap my brain around the current state of the field. I started to write up like, basically explain it to myself.

360
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:37.040
Logan Pearce (she/her): with all of the citations correctly. you know, cited so that future me can.

361
00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:44.270
Logan Pearce (she/her): you know, find easily find citations for a field or for a claim. I can show you, my

362
00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:48.900
Logan Pearce (she/her): my

363
00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:59.410
Logan Pearce (she/her): explainer that I wrote to myself, which you know this is now is this later now is going to be part of a chapter of my thesis for sure. But

364
00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:03.390
Jay Farris: so would you do that like? So then you You're just kind of taking.

365
00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:08.010
Jay Farris: You know that. What? So? What is it? You know when you're putting it into your

366
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:12.910
Jay Farris: thoughts to solidify your learning.

367
00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.650
Logan Pearce (she/her): I guess.

368
00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:20.030
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah. I just kind of wrote it as if

369
00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:24.350
Logan Pearce (she/her): I were writing a literature review or a paper myself.

370
00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.740
Logan Pearce (she/her): So I even wrote an abstract.

371
00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.640
Logan Pearce (she/her): So like, you know, I wrote.

372
00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:35.200
Logan Pearce (she/her): I basically just like described the whole state of what I was, the field of what I was learning

373
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:37.070
Logan Pearce (she/her): with the appropriate

374
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:50.120
Logan Pearce (she/her): citations so like this first sentence, you know, this concept comes from this paper. and I explained it so that other people could read it and understand. It's like as if if I were writing a journal article.

375
00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:56.530
Logan Pearce (she/her): So this is what I did with relevant plots.

376
00:35:56.770 --> 00:36:08.700
Logan Pearce (she/her): I started doing this once I started to read so many papers that I, starting to feel like I needed to organize my thoughts. This is how I organize my thoughts. I just explained it to someone else, you know, as if I were explaining it to someone else.

377
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:10.770
Logan Pearce (she/her): Explain it to myself.

378
00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.810
Logan Pearce (she/her): All these plots and citations, and

379
00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:15.890
Logan Pearce (she/her): the references are

380
00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:20.060
Logan Pearce (she/her): here. It's like 6 pages of reference.

381
00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.550
Logan Pearce (she/her): It's something for good papers.

382
00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:33.060
Jay Farris: so that's like. Now it's useful to you in the sense that you can go back and grab stuff out of if you wanted to.

383
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:36.710
Logan Pearce (she/her): My Doc is harassing me to get this toy up from for her.

384
00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.700
Jay Farris: Okay.

385
00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.760
Logan Pearce (she/her): Sorry. She's very helpless. She can't get the toward herself.

386
00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:54.610
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah. But like. I have like 6 pages of references here. But I did not read all of these like not even close A lot of them were just

387
00:36:54.940 --> 00:37:02.680
Logan Pearce (she/her): backing up like a half a half of a statement that I made, or you know, or examples of something like I in no way read all of these.

388
00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:09.830
Logan Pearce (she/her): I read a lot of them. but like for comparison the ones that I took notes on there's

389
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:13.080
Logan Pearce (she/her): on the order of 20, maybe 30

390
00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:14.570
Logan Pearce (she/her): that I took notes on.

391
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.410
Logan Pearce (she/her): So.

392
00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:22.040
Logan Pearce (she/her): But yeah, this is how I like

393
00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:27.130
Logan Pearce (she/her): Organize my thoughts was by explaining it to someone else.

394
00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:31.030
Logan Pearce (she/her): There's a trick in coding.

395
00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.010
Logan Pearce (she/her): called the Rubber Ducky Trick.

396
00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:36.140
Logan Pearce (she/her): I don't know

397
00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:42.540
Logan Pearce (she/her): if you are stuck in your code and you can't figure out what's wrong.

398
00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:45.110
Logan Pearce (she/her): You. You explain it to your rubber duck.

399
00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:54.050
Logan Pearce (she/her): so I have a little rubber deck here, so you explain it in the in explaining to your rubber deck what your code is doing. It helps you find the problem.

400
00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:03.450
Logan Pearce (she/her): So so that's what I did with this document. I explained it to my rubber duck

401
00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:08.840
Jay Farris: with all the preferences you do, I? I I do something similar with

402
00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:15.450
Jay Farris: when I try to explain something, I imagine i'm in a room full of judgmental people.

403
00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:20.430
Jay Farris: sharp shooting, everything I say. And then I I how do I explain this?

404
00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:25.840
Jay Farris: And then usually that kind of gets me over the over the home.

405
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:31.840
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah. I did this a a while ago. There was

406
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:44.410
Logan Pearce (she/her): some little concept that I was trying to make sure I fully understood, and so I wrote up a little explainer like this, and summarized a bunch of literature on this concept. It wasn't it was only a couple of pages. It wasn't very long.

407
00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:50.450
Logan Pearce (she/her): but I put it on my website, and I have gotten multiple people. Now tell me that they

408
00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:59.140
Logan Pearce (she/her): have used my explainer to like, help them understand it. And if you Google, this concept, my paper is one of my unpublished little

409
00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:06.760
Logan Pearce (she/her): explainer is one of the top results. So a lot of people have told me that they found it and found it useful.

410
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:09.850
Logan Pearce (she/her): So, even though I wrote it for myself.

411
00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:13.090
Logan Pearce (she/her): I put it up here and for everybody, so

412
00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:20.820
Logan Pearce (she/her): i'm not gonna do that with this one, though, because this is my like experimental design that's mine. So, like I don't want people to scoop me.

413
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.900
Logan Pearce (she/her): But yeah.

414
00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:34.410
Jay Farris: maybe i'll do it once. My, now i'm in a separate field. So what's what's your what's your design on that?

415
00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:39.730
Jay Farris: It is? I mean, that's just kind of what you're like. How are you organizing it?

416
00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:41.380
Logan Pearce (she/her): Organizing what

417
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:44.760
Jay Farris: the your this. your big one.

418
00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:48.820
Jay Farris: my my survey.

419
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:53.080
Jay Farris: or the paper like? How do I organize the paper.

420
00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:57.270
Logan Pearce (she/her): Well, it's, you know. It's specific to this field.

421
00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:59.900
Logan Pearce (she/her): So i'm looking at

422
00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:01.810
Logan Pearce (she/her): white dwarfs

423
00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:11.610
Logan Pearce (she/her): where there's a white door which again is the burned out basically core of star. And then there's another

424
00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:16.590
Logan Pearce (she/her): regular burning star call in a sequence star.

425
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:19.030
Logan Pearce (she/her): and they're bound their binaries. They orbit each other.

426
00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.450
Logan Pearce (she/her): So

427
00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:23.950
Logan Pearce (she/her): So it's organized by like

428
00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:26.720
Logan Pearce (she/her): big picture

429
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:30.580
Logan Pearce (she/her): big picture. First like, how do we

430
00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.170
Logan Pearce (she/her): use white dwarfs

431
00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.100
Logan Pearce (she/her): to study planets? Because that's what i'm doing.

432
00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:38.500
Logan Pearce (she/her): And then

433
00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:41.610
Logan Pearce (she/her): specifically.

434
00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:46.500
Logan Pearce (she/her): how does the binary enter in so sort of big with

435
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:49.020
Logan Pearce (she/her): who did white dwarfs

436
00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:53.400
Logan Pearce (she/her): just for setting planets? And then it's. How does the binary come into this?

437
00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:54.840
Logan Pearce (she/her): And then

438
00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.830
Logan Pearce (she/her): here it goes to

439
00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:05.570
Logan Pearce (she/her): current state of using, like observing these things, so using telescopes to look at them.

440
00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:09.550
Logan Pearce (she/her): and then then then it goes to

441
00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:14.370
Logan Pearce (she/her): narrow to my survey design. and how my survey is gonna

442
00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:18.380
Logan Pearce (she/her): impact this field.

443
00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:24.260
Logan Pearce (she/her): and why it's designed the way it is, and stuff. and then it goes

444
00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:30.810
Logan Pearce (she/her): back out to the future and to in the big, the big picture question.

445
00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:35.020
Logan Pearce (she/her): Have you heard of the the hourglass manuscript design?

446
00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:47.850
Jay Farris: No, but I I I know I've heard of it, because that's what you did in your other other thing, right on your

447
00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:50.260
Jay Farris: from it.

448
00:41:50.610 --> 00:42:02.500
Logan Pearce (she/her): Never mind. I haven't heard of it. Okay, the idea is Well, there's lots of different graphics here that may or may not be relevant. But the idea is this: this is how the best way to structure

449
00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:08.580
Logan Pearce (she/her): a article, a journal article, literature, view, any kind of

450
00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:11.940
Logan Pearce (she/her): any kind of

451
00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.870
Logan Pearce (she/her): thing where you're trying to share. How you

452
00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:20.900
Logan Pearce (she/her): did your science basically like you can. You can use this for

453
00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:22.910
Logan Pearce (she/her): articles and for

454
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:26.650
Logan Pearce (she/her): talks like our posts are like if you're in a poster or a talk.

455
00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:32.230
Logan Pearce (she/her): Same idea. So the idea is that you start Big Broad. What is the big picture?

456
00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:34.340
Logan Pearce (she/her): Scientific goal

457
00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:39.620
Logan Pearce (she/her): state of the current state of knowledge, and whatever this field is.

458
00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:46.150
Logan Pearce (she/her): background, knowledge, and then you kind of narrow to like. What are some of the open questions

459
00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:50.200
Logan Pearce (she/her): in whatever this field is, and then

460
00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:53.510
Logan Pearce (she/her): how? What you did will address

461
00:42:53.710 --> 00:43:00.000
Logan Pearce (she/her): those questions, and then the narrowest part is what you did. it's, and then

462
00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:03.310
Logan Pearce (she/her): then go back out to

463
00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:10.130
Logan Pearce (she/her): bigger question. Go back out to the big picture again, so discuss how what you did fits into the

464
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:19.440
Logan Pearce (she/her): the current state of things, and then go out in conclude with that big picture conclusion again. So how what you did

465
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.780
Logan Pearce (she/her): contributes to the big picture.

466
00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:22.700
Basically.

467
00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:24.940
Logan Pearce (she/her): So yeah, you start really broad.

468
00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:31.150
Logan Pearce (she/her): narrow, down to what you did, and then back out, brought again to the big question, the big picture.

469
00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:39.550
Logan Pearce (she/her): and as this one illustrates that roughly correlates to the introduction.

470
00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:42.390
Logan Pearce (she/her): being the big picture, and then

471
00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:49.050
Logan Pearce (she/her): the methods and results being the narrow part, what you did, and then back out again in the discussion and conclusions.

472
00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:53.020
Logan Pearce (she/her): Here's another one.

473
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:57.840
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah.

474
00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:08.810
Logan Pearce (she/her): Background, knowledge, areas of uncertainty. What you did comparison with literature, strength, limitations, and efficiently features. This is going to vary based on the field. But

475
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:11.290
Logan Pearce (she/her): here is another one

476
00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:19.710
Logan Pearce (she/her): background. Challenge. Yeah, what's the specific problem. You're trying to address what you did, and then back out

477
00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:22.110
Logan Pearce (she/her): to the broad picture.

478
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:33.460
Logan Pearce (she/her): This is always a really good structure. especially when you're giving a talk when you give a talk like you spend 90 of your time

479
00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:42.860
Logan Pearce (she/her): doing in your talk. You so in your talk you spend like 10 talking about of your time talking about what you spend 90% of your time doing

480
00:44:44.650 --> 00:44:54.140
Logan Pearce (she/her): because they don't, you know they don't need to super a lot of detail with your methods. They just really need They Listeners really need the big picture more. And how what you did fit into the big picture.

481
00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.000
Logan Pearce (she/her): So yeah.

482
00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:03.240
Logan Pearce (she/her): this is a good rule of them

483
00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:05.590
Logan Pearce (she/her): for yeah structuring papers.

484
00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:12.200
Logan Pearce (she/her): And I recommend, if you're reading a paper, I recommend seeing how

485
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:14.410
Logan Pearce (she/her): how the author

486
00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:16.390
Logan Pearce (she/her): tried to accomplish this

487
00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:18.650
Logan Pearce (she/her): also

488
00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:28.210
Logan Pearce (she/her): questions, thoughts, comments.

489
00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:35.510
Logan Pearce (she/her): good stuff

490
00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:42.740
Jay Farris: sounds great. Thank you.

491
00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:46.940
fioravanti: Yeah, that's a that's a great little guide.

492
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:48.370
Logan Pearce (she/her): Cool.

493
00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.090
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah, definitely. Don't

494
00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:56.220
Logan Pearce (she/her): a po approach articles the same as you would approach books or

495
00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:00.820
Logan Pearce (she/her): English

496
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:06.380
Roslyn Grizzard: here for 30 years, and white papers and journals. I would read them like books.

497
00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:17.520
Roslyn Grizzard: and it's not how they're supposed to be.

498
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:18.670
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah.

499
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:29.340
Logan Pearce (she/her): So I did. Before I went back to school for astronomy. I was a public school teacher, and I got a masters in education during that.

500
00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:36.000
Logan Pearce (she/her): And so I was during that masters program. I was reading tons of education. Papers and

501
00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:39.000
Social science papers are long

502
00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:58.780
Logan Pearce (she/her): way longer than astronomy papers. They are like on the regular 30 to 50 pages on the regular, and we would be assigned, you know, 2 or 3 or 4 papers every night, and I would read them from beginning to end, and my eyes we glaze over because nobody ever told me how to read a paper like.

503
00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:01.320
Nobody ever told me how to digest a paper

504
00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:09.840
Logan Pearce (she/her): like it's one thing to read it, read every word, but like to digest it and understand what it's saying. No one ever taught me this. So like

505
00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:16.750
Logan Pearce (she/her): it was. It was pretty rough trying to read all of those education papers

506
00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:25.640
Logan Pearce (she/her): when I got to astronomy, and I was like. This is only a 10 page paper. Oh, my God, it's so great because it's used to these social science papers that we're so freaking along.

507
00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:27.470
Logan Pearce (she/her): So

508
00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:39.660
Logan Pearce (she/her): So yeah. don't read it from beginning to. unless it's super relevant. And you're really trying to learn what the paper says

509
00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:43.420
Logan Pearce (she/her): that I've read every word

510
00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:54.410
Jay Farris: do you have like? Yeah. So there's like kind of I know, like when pure I gave his class, you know he has these. I I can't remember what you call them fiore. But like the Seminole

511
00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:57.550
Jay Farris: works that you kind of just go back to

512
00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:01.880
Jay Farris: that are like your saves, so to speak. I guess.

513
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:03.410
Jay Farris: Okay.

514
00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:12.220
fioravanti: So you know, and backwards and forwards I'm: sure. Oh, yeah, I mean. But but I think in my, when when I did my

515
00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:14.020
fioravanti: graduate work.

516
00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:20.260
fioravanti: which was a British literature in Britain. My teachers were very adversarial.

517
00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:29.930
fioravanti: That's the way they approach literature, and I don't mean in political ways the way they do in the United States, but just very, very aggressive, almost legalistic. You know. I was talking to Kate about this.

518
00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:36.170
Logan Pearce (she/her): and so I kind of got into looking at text, and the way that they argue with each other.

519
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:40.150
fioravanti: and almost like getting into that head of like picking a part of text.

520
00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:51.790
fioravanti: And so this certain seminal works, especially books. You know, books books suck because they're they're they're old like By the time the book is published. It's the researchers of 10 to 15 years old.

521
00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:58.640
fioravanti: But books are great because they filter out peer-reviewed journalists really well, because whoever wrote the book wherever edited the book.

522
00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:13.740
fioravanti: So though that's what I mean by some. It works like a really great book in your field will be actually a nice little bibliography for peer-reviewed journals and peer-reviewed journals themselves are, you know I kind of read them in an adversarial way against each other kind of like.

523
00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:22.880
fioravanti: you know, and that's more fun for me, because rather than try to absorb everything, I kind of just look at like how what you know how Logan was showing you that web before

524
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:40.250
fioravanti: right? So that's kind of in my head like. How do these authors kind of like argue with each other in this little constellation, you know. So yeah, certain certain certain period Journal Peer reviewed text. I I know, like I almost can just recite what they said, because

525
00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:52.600
fioravanti: i'm so angry about it, and somebody else is so angry about it. It's like the web of hate, you know. But yeah, it's different than science. You know. It's quite different than science. It's

526
00:49:52.630 --> 00:50:04.590
Logan Pearce (she/her): so Similarly, we have things called literature, reviews, books, Books tend to be more textbooks in my field, and so they're great. But like, if you want, like

527
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:23.820
Logan Pearce (she/her): like bibliography for a specific field. Literature review is is going to be that kind of a that kind of a standard like you're talking about. Feel right? So like this is one, for example, Jura and Young, 2,014 on basically extra solar cause we're here, which basically means like

528
00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:27.880
Logan Pearce (she/her): the learning about the chemistry of planets using why doors.

529
00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:40.290
Logan Pearce (she/her): stars. and so like you can see I've highlighted the crap out of this, but it has, because it's a literature view. It has these really like foundational plots like this is this is like

530
00:50:40.690 --> 00:50:51.150
Logan Pearce (she/her): the schematic of metals, and in white dwarfs that you will see in in all kinds of talks, because this is like just a seminal like, here's the basics

531
00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:52.800
Logan Pearce (she/her): figure.

532
00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:58.320
Logan Pearce (she/her): and then so tons of figures, and then tons of bibliography.

533
00:50:59.130 --> 00:51:00.270
Logan Pearce (she/her): Really you.

534
00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:06.320
Logan Pearce (she/her): this is like a this is like a summary of this field to date is what a literature view is.

535
00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:17.150
Logan Pearce (she/her): So talking about how to find relevant papers finding a literature review that's relevant. That's the topic you are interested in. And then, looking at their bibliography, what they site and reference.

536
00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:21.410
Logan Pearce (she/her): we'll send you to a lot of useful papers

537
00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:26.900
Logan Pearce (she/her): talking about papers that I read and know, like the back of my hand

538
00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:34.510
Logan Pearce (she/her): in my field, we often will talk about Mali, 2,014, Just where is my 2,014,

539
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:36.260
Logan Pearce (she/her): my way? 2,014.

540
00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:42.490
Logan Pearce (she/her): This one describes how to do this one calculation.

541
00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:50.720
Logan Pearce (she/her): This is it. Actually, it's just how to do this calculation. You already know what it is. But this is how you do this one calculation, my way

542
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:59.930
Logan Pearce (she/her): to always section 3 1 2, and 14, section 3, and so like Molly 2014. This is a shorthand. It'll be like, oh, yeah.

543
00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:10.840
Logan Pearce (she/her): how did I do this? Oh, I did my way. 2,014, and everybody was like, oh, okay, you know, like cause it's just such a like foundational way to do this one thing that everybody does

544
00:52:11.050 --> 00:52:15.100
Logan Pearce (she/her): that everyone knows just like, oh, yeah, you know, I use my way, you know.

545
00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:17.230
Logan Pearce (she/her): So

546
00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:21.610
Jay Farris: So how do? How do you discern, like, what's a good literature review?

547
00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:24.770
Jay Farris: Do you just kind of pick it up by word of mouth, or

548
00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:29.210
Logan Pearce (she/her): Google. or the

549
00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:32.450
Logan Pearce (she/her): any other like article search service.

550
00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:38.900
Logan Pearce (she/her): and then look for the ones that I mean. Read the abstracts and titles

551
00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:43.300
Logan Pearce (she/her): to see if it's what you're looking for, and then look for the newer ones.

552
00:52:44.170 --> 00:52:48.700
Logan Pearce (she/her): because their goal is to summarize the research to date. So

553
00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:53.760
Logan Pearce (she/her): you want to get the the newest one. This is 2,014. So there's been a lot of work

554
00:52:54.020 --> 00:53:02.530
Logan Pearce (she/her): in this field since this. but you know I read the I read the show on this paper because you you got me up to speed to 2,014,

555
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:09.750
Logan Pearce (she/her): and then, you know, I can go but go beyond that, and then I can look for papers that have cited this paper to to go beyond that.

556
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:12.960
Logan Pearce (she/her): But yeah, definitely

557
00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:23.040
Jay Farris: so are the literature reviews like who who who generally writes, those are they leaders in the field editors, or

558
00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:24.880
Logan Pearce (she/her): usually leaders in the field.

559
00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:28.430
Jay Farris: This guy Jura has written like

560
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:32.810
Logan Pearce (she/her): a 1 million papers on this topic like I've read so many of his papers.

561
00:53:32.890 --> 00:53:35.940
Logan Pearce (she/her): So usually yeah leaders in the field.

562
00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:40.780
Logan Pearce (she/her): It just kind of like, if you feel like an

563
00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:48.280
Logan Pearce (she/her): enough that you feel like there's enough out there that someone should summarize it. Generally somebody will like another one in my field. Is this

564
00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:50.880
Logan Pearce (she/her): roller 2,016? Where is it?

565
00:53:51.790 --> 00:54:04.280
Logan Pearce (she/her): Or 2,016? This is another one. That's a literature view that's really foundational. So I I actually worked with Brendan Bowler. So that's how I knew about this. This One's really foundational, like people cite this

566
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:06.750
Logan Pearce (she/her): like crazy. So

567
00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:10.440
Logan Pearce (she/her): I think I found that, like if you just

568
00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:13.470
Logan Pearce (she/her): here's the thing. If you just start reading

569
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:21.410
Logan Pearce (she/her): or skimming the introduction of papers that are relevant you. These same seminal papers are going to come up again and again.

570
00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:30.480
Logan Pearce (she/her): right because everyone is going to be citing them. So what I was when I was really diving into trying to learn this new field I

571
00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:33.190
Logan Pearce (she/her): would like

572
00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:36.190
Logan Pearce (she/her): right down all night.

573
00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:44.850
Logan Pearce (she/her): Cool. Hi, Rosalind. you know I would. I would write down these references.

574
00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:52.380
Logan Pearce (she/her): and to come. In fact, I even have in my zotero. I even have a to read folder.

575
00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:55.220
Logan Pearce (she/her): so I would collect the ones that I needed to read.

576
00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:07.990
Logan Pearce (she/her): but and depending on the context clues within the introduction that I was reading, could tell me if it was like how vital it was to read this paper or not like who that one sounds really important, like I need to read that one.

577
00:55:08.290 --> 00:55:13.760
Logan Pearce (she/her): But yeah, the the really similar papers are just gonna They're just gonna keep coming up

578
00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:15.570
because everyone's going to sign them.

579
00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:19.650
Logan Pearce (she/her): So using the introduction of papers

580
00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:21.970
Logan Pearce (she/her): is super useful, super helpful.

581
00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:37.940
fioravanti: So I was, You know Th: that's amazing. All this stuff you have. I was just a a thought about these other fields like psychology, cognitive sign, cognitive. Well.

582
00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:47.340
fioravanti: the more the more kind of issue driven cognitive science, right? So I i'm i'm like I'm like naturally a very distrustful reader.

583
00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:53.620
and and in my field there's so many lame papers right there's many, many bad papers, so

584
00:55:53.720 --> 00:56:10.730
fioravanti: I go more. I I what I do is I I kind of have a couple of authors that I trust, like. I just feel that they're very ethical. I, even though I don't agree with Steven Pinker on many things. I trust him because he's very self correcting. So if he's re written an introduction to something.

585
00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:23.670
fioravanti: I will use that introduction. As you know, he he will include literary reviews, and almost every book he writes. He kind of reviews all the literature up and then, and a lot of writers won't do that even great writers

586
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:38.500
fioravanti: I have an act to grind, and so they won't do that. So I I kind of learned to trust certain writers like Logan was saying about Jura, and I know that that their books will be valuable just to filter out stuff right rather than like pure information, you know.

587
00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:54.550
fioravanti: and I I trust the bibliography is more. It's just like it kind of work through these Mentor, the Mentor kind of model of studying, you know. But I think with scientists, You guys, you know you guys have so much more rigorous that you can. You have a wider scope to to gather information.

588
00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:58.340
Logan Pearce (she/her): Oh, another important source for

589
00:56:58.370 --> 00:57:02.340
Logan Pearce (she/her): finding important papers is your advisor

590
00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:09.240
Logan Pearce (she/her): and your colleagues. you know. If if if you're starting to work with an advisor

591
00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:14.460
Logan Pearce (she/her): like right when you start whatever project you're working on, They're probably gonna hand you

592
00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:19.250
Logan Pearce (she/her): 5 6 7 8 papers that are like, Start here. Here's where you need to start.

593
00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:21.430
Logan Pearce (she/her): So

594
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.860
Yeah.

595
00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:27.700
Logan Pearce (she/her): that's another very important resource that Hasn't been mentioned yet.

596
00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:37.510
Logan Pearce (she/her): Cool.

597
00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:42.010
Jay Farris: Great? Thank you. Good luck.

598
00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:46.070
Jay Farris: Awesome. It's exactly what I was looking for. For.

599
00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:51.540
Logan Pearce (she/her): I'm glad. Yeah, like, I said, this is tricky stuff that Isn't always taught

600
00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:53.130
Logan Pearce (she/her): like

601
00:57:53.370 --> 00:57:57.300
Jay Farris: my difficult.

602
00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:03.760
Jay Farris: They never. No one taught me this. So okay, you did it. The

603
00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:13.920
Jay Farris: you know I i'm a person Those things like the hard way all the time, and so like the do you, looking back on your masters, and then doing your your masters and your Phd.

604
00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:27.590
Jay Farris: And astronomy. Now, is there a huge difference that you now have? These skills like you would wish you could kind of like, not wish, but like, just send the message back in time to your old self and be like.

605
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:32.460
Jay Farris: I mean, sure, yeah, sure. I mean

606
00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:43.350
Logan Pearce (she/her): It'd be nice not to spend 4 h at a coffee shop reading 2 papers, you know, like that was, you know, wasted effort, but I didn't

607
00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:47.770
Logan Pearce (she/her): no any better, because all the reading I had done up until that point was

608
00:58:47.810 --> 00:58:49.340
Logan Pearce (she/her): not that kind of reading.

609
00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:50.620
Jay Farris: So

610
00:58:51.830 --> 00:59:01.470
Logan Pearce (she/her): there's you know, there's a concept called the hidden curriculum of academia, which is this things that everyone just kind of seems to know. But nobody ever teaches

611
00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:06.200
Logan Pearce (she/her): like how to read journal article or like. you know.

612
00:59:07.330 --> 00:59:08.670
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah, I don't know.

613
00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:10.260
Logan Pearce (she/her): and it's a

614
00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:16.320
Logan Pearce (she/her): The hidden curriculum is a there is a barrier for people especially like

615
00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:19.480
Logan Pearce (she/her): first-generation academics, especially

616
00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:29.970
Logan Pearce (she/her): who you know are trying to break into Academia and Don't have this roadmap to things that their peers seem to know already.

617
00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:33.340
Logan Pearce (she/her): So yeah, so it's important to be

618
00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:36.050
Logan Pearce (she/her): transparent

619
00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:38.590
Logan Pearce (she/her): with with these kind of things, I think.

620
00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:42.540
Jay Farris: Does this help like in your

621
00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:50.570
Jay Farris: in your writing and stuff like that? That's one of my things, and I I don't think I don't think we've done anything on writing

622
00:59:51.920 --> 01:00:02.220
Jay Farris: for the for so like the skills that you pick up for research reading, and then I guess that all helps on time management to

623
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:09.590
Jay Farris: that like. Are you able to be more prolific as a writer? This do you think that's helped as far as

624
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:12.240
Jay Farris: your reading skills and stuff like that.

625
01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:16.240
Logan Pearce (she/her): I mean, yeah.

626
01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:17.390
Logan Pearce (she/her): for sure.

627
01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:28.200
Jay Farris: i'm not a 100%, sure, I understand. But so I guess i'd say, like, do you feel like what what you say like the well, I guess. Let me be more clear. So like your method, as far as like.

628
01:00:28.530 --> 01:00:35.990
Jay Farris: you know, extrapolate and information, and then writing it down in your own thoughts. Are you able to go back? Does that make your writing easier?

629
01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:45.690
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah, for sure? So so I've spent like months and months and months on writing that explainer that I showed you.

630
01:00:45.720 --> 01:01:04.720
Logan Pearce (she/her): And then just last week, I needed to write a telescope proposal. So basically the proposal to ask for a time on a telescope for this project. And so I was like, oh, I've got the science, the science justification down, and I was just like what like, how do I summarize Basically, how I take this like 20 page document and summarize it in a page.

631
01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:14.870
Logan Pearce (she/her): But like that was that was super easy, and I already had. I already have the basic structure of the argument. I already had references that were relevant, and so putting the science justification together was really easy.

632
01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:24.680
Logan Pearce (she/her): And yeah, like, I said, this document is probably going to be a chapter in my thesis, you know, like I've already got it kind of done. So.

633
01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:29.870
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah, because doing the writing of that.

634
01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:31.260
Logan Pearce (she/her): the explainer document

635
01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:38.630
Logan Pearce (she/her): forced me to organize my thoughts. And so now I have a really good handle on

636
01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:48.990
Logan Pearce (she/her): the science case for this project that i'm doing, and so I can talk about it, and I can write about it pretty quickly, because I've already been forced to think through it all the way.

637
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:57.180
Logan Pearce (she/her): and in doing the work of thinking through it like other things, occurred to me like oh, I should add this, or I just need to pull that, or like you know

638
01:01:57.290 --> 01:02:03.650
Logan Pearce (she/her): it. It helps me like wrap my brain around it. And now I can talk about this project really intelligently.

639
01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:06.460
Logan Pearce (she/her): because I've had to think through it already.

640
01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:10.760
Logan Pearce (she/her): But there's also

641
01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:14.230
Logan Pearce (she/her): different. There's different types of writing in academia

642
01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.250
Jay Farris: like

643
01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:19.160
Logan Pearce (she/her): the first paper that I wrote for astronomy.

644
01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:21.870
Logan Pearce (she/her): One of the hardest things for me was

645
01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:31.970
Logan Pearce (she/her): like, okay, I know what I want to say. How do I say it in the way that readers expect to read it? Because the type of writing is different

646
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:35.440
Logan Pearce (she/her): than what I was used to so

647
01:02:36.050 --> 01:02:40.790
Logan Pearce (she/her): like figuring out how to say it in like astronomy language. You know science, words

648
01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:44.660
Logan Pearce (she/her): was hard, and it just took

649
01:02:45.730 --> 01:02:51.100
Logan Pearce (she/her): doing it and getting feedback from my advisor and other co-authors

650
01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:57.510
Logan Pearce (she/her): helped me, You know, shape the language into like discipline Norms

651
01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:02.700
Logan Pearce (she/her): So that was that was really challenging, and I still struggle with it. I'm still way too worried.

652
01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:04.730
Logan Pearce (she/her): I still need to

653
01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:11.450
Logan Pearce (she/her): shortened concise sentences. But writing a journal article is very different from writing an application essay.

654
01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:16.470
Logan Pearce (she/her): you know. That's a whole different kind of writing.

655
01:03:17.410 --> 01:03:20.660
Logan Pearce (she/her): So these are hidden curriculum things that

656
01:03:21.010 --> 01:03:22.480
Logan Pearce (she/her): people don't often talk about.

657
01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:30.110
Jay Farris: So so just now following up on that, so do you. So when you you, by reading, you know all your

658
01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.040
Jay Farris: this is more of a writing question.

659
01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:35.790
Jay Farris: But, like you're reading of the research.

660
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:38.800
Jay Farris: it's seen how other people say it.

661
01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:45.200
Jay Farris: or you know, was that helpful? You're like I like the way that person said that. And so

662
01:03:45.580 --> 01:04:03.270
Jay Farris: i'm gonna build their style, you know here and there. The problem, then, is to how do I not say it? Word for word the way they said it like, make it my words, but still good where it's like. It's all hard for me. This is hard. Take this language. Yeah.

663
01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:08.390
Logan Pearce (she/her): I mean, these are things I struggled with when I I I still struggle with. But

664
01:04:11.790 --> 01:04:12.600
Logan Pearce (she/her): yeah.

665
01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.020
Jay Farris: cool.

666
01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:21.790
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah, it was just kind of a thing to figure out was like, how do people in this discipline say things.

667
01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:26.690
Yeah.

668
01:04:28.450 --> 01:04:36.380
Logan Pearce (she/her): I've collected a lot of writing academia writing resources on my website.

669
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:40.610
Logan Pearce (she/her): I think I publish some in this classroom as well.

670
01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:49.230
Logan Pearce (she/her): but my website is kind of where I compile things when I haven't when I see something cool i'm like oh, i'll save that for later by just putting it on my website or a link to it. So

671
01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:53.860
Logan Pearce (she/her): there's a lot specifically on

672
01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:57.600

673
01:05:01.110 --> 01:05:05.220
Logan Pearce (she/her): It's log in here, Science dot com slash resources.

674
01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:12.070
Logan Pearce (she/her): So

675

678
01:05:36.210 --> 01:05:45.220
Logan Pearce (she/her): yeah, I mean, I was. I was a paper notebook person forever, until I finally

679
