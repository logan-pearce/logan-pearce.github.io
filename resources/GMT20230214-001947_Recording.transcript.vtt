00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.090
Logan Pearce (she/her): Okay, it's recording.

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.400
Hi. So

3
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.160
Logan Pearce (she/her): i'm Logan. You probably know me already, and fury is here. We

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.110
Logan Pearce (she/her): I was going to host the academic

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.130
Logan Pearce (she/her): tools for research tools, workshop.

6
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.670
Logan Pearce (she/her): Nobody was able to make it, which is fine. So what i'm gonna do instead is just record

7
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:35.610
Logan Pearce (she/her): me showing off the tools that I use in my research, and if you're I can do some of the things he uses, and then just call it.

8
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.800
Logan Pearce (she/her): We call it that.

9
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.440
Yeah. So I posted some things on the

10
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.660
Logan Pearce (she/her): classroom

11
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:48.040
Logan Pearce (she/her): of just stuff that I was gonna share about. So i'm just gonna walk through those and tell you

12
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.870
Logan Pearce (she/her): why I like them, and what I use and

13
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.150
Logan Pearce (she/her): how it's helpful.

14
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.210
But yeah.

15
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.050
Logan Pearce (she/her): So i'm going to share my screen.

16
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.090
Logan Pearce (she/her): And yeah, this doesn't have to be formal or anything. So you already just, you know, pipe up a few.

17
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.220
Logan Pearce (she/her): So

18
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.740
Logan Pearce (she/her): the the goal of this is to share tools that I that I use for

19
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.160
Logan Pearce (she/her): can engaging with literature in my research.

20
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.280
Logan Pearce (she/her): because.

21
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.730
Logan Pearce (she/her): like managing an academic library, and like being sure I can find all the papers how to find all the papers. I need how to

22
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.680
Logan Pearce (she/her): keep track of all the papers and what they do and manage a bibliography, and all of that. It can get really overwhelming really quickly.

23
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.140
Logan Pearce (she/her): So first of all, for finding

24
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.940
Logan Pearce (she/her): relevant papers.

25
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:59.890
Logan Pearce (she/her): Google Scholar is like, I I think, probably the preeminent tool for this. I actually don't use Google scholar because i'm in astrophysics field, and we actually use

26
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.220
Logan Pearce (she/her): this thing called a and NASA ads to ask your physics data system

27
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.840
Logan Pearce (she/her): for searching papers and it's. Fantastic, and I love it. But

28
00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:12.850
Logan Pearce (she/her): you're seeing my screen right.

29
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.200
fioravanti: Let me see you.

30
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.510
Logan Pearce (she/her): You see my screen.

31
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:31.720
Logan Pearce (she/her): but it's only a relevant to us astronomy and physics. So i'm going to show you how to do the same kinds of things that I do with ads with Google Scholar.

32
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.490
Logan Pearce (she/her): S0 0kay, so with Google scholar, you want to make a profile.

33
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.650
Logan Pearce (she/her): so I made myself a profile. This is definitely something that you want to do with.

34
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:59.830
Logan Pearce (she/her): You know my name, my picture. This is a silly picture of telescopes that I use for all of my professional things, because i'm ridiculous. I put in the like fields that I used, and

35
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.180
Logan Pearce (she/her): below I have all of the papers that my name is on. So

36
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.260
these are all papers that I've contributed to like. So, for example. where's one of my papers.

37
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:24.080
Logan Pearce (she/her): These are all papers by other people that i'm on here. Here's one of mine so like here's my here's my name, you know, and I can see

38
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.620
Logan Pearce (she/her): the year, and that 28 people have cited this paper. That's kind of crazy.

39
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.500
Logan Pearce (she/her): I could see who cited my paper.

40
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:44.610
Logan Pearce (she/her): even if you Don't have any papers. It's a good thing to make a profile even like this doesn't just have papers that I've written. This also has like conference proceedings

41
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.210
Logan Pearce (she/her): like.

42
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.710
where's one? This one is this one was part of

43
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:58.330
Logan Pearce (she/her): the Spi Conference, so like those kind of things are on there, too, so you you can find those things on Google Scholar

44
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.660
Logan Pearce (she/her): and add them to your

45
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:12.670
Logan Pearce (she/her): to your library or your profile, and then people can follow you and stuff. So this is so that people can find you and find your work. and if you have a website you can link

46
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.860
Logan Pearce (she/her): to this. S0 0n my website. Here's my website

47
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.490
Logan Pearce (she/her): on my website.

48
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.370
Here are my pop publications. I have it links straight to my ads library, right?

49
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:35.120
Logan Pearce (she/her): Which is the same thing as like the profile on Google Scholar. So this way: if people want to know the science that I've done it's like right there on my website.

50
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.110
Logan Pearce (she/her): a publication list for me. And I did the same over here at Google Scholar.

51
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.100
Logan Pearce (she/her): just to show you all, even though I don't actually

52
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.590
okay. So how do you do that? So let's say.

53
00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:10.920
Logan Pearce (she/her): I want to find earlier. I looked up non interacting polluted white our binaries because that science that I do. So I put in a topic from science that I do polluted by door finders.

54
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:19.000
Logan Pearce (she/her): I don't see that are too interesting to me. But let's say one thing I don't like about Google Scholar

55
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:29.600
Logan Pearce (she/her): is that this is not in a good order like this. 1,994 paper is the first result. whereas like this 2,020 paper is below.

56
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:37.180
Logan Pearce (she/her): I don't love that.

57
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.730
Logan Pearce (she/her): I I don't know. But anyway.

58
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.450
let's say I wanted to. I'm interested in this paper

59
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:51.210
Logan Pearce (she/her): click on it, and it takes me to the paper. I'm: I'm: not on school.

60
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.870
Logan Pearce (she/her): So I don't know if i'm going to be able to access this or I can access it. Okay.

61
00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.360
But yeah, so there's the paper.

62
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:06.840
Logan Pearce (she/her): So if I want to save it to my library. I can click on, save. So the star button.

63
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:19.040
Logan Pearce (she/her): I made a polluted white dwarfs library. So any papers that relate to polluted white dwarfs go in there done now when I go to my library.

64
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.190
Logan Pearce (she/her): There's that paper that I collected.

65
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:27.790
Logan Pearce (she/her): So this is a way to like, collect and organized papers within Google Scholar

66
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.910
fioravanti: that are relevant. That's great

67
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.290
Logan Pearce (she/her): and stuff.

68
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.860
Logan Pearce (she/her): I wish that it came out as

69
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.610
Logan Pearce (she/her): date order, though not well.

70
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.650
And then there's one more thing export all, so you can actually export

71
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.260
Logan Pearce (she/her): the bibliography.

72
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:53.870
Logan Pearce (she/her): So if I want to make it a Csd. That's a comma separated values. File.

73
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.430
Logan Pearce (she/her): You see what that looks like.

74
00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:02.480
Logan Pearce (she/her): So here's the export that I just did with all of the bibliography information right there.

75
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:10.070
Logan Pearce (she/her): So if I had, like a whole list of papers that i'd collect it. I can export them all at once, and end up with a

76
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.500
Logan Pearce (she/her): with the bibliography right there.

77
00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.410
Logan Pearce (she/her): So that's pretty cool.

78
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.900
fioravanti: That's beautiful.

79
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.520
Logan Pearce (she/her): And when I, when I made the profile

80
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:33.620
Logan Pearce (she/her): when I made my profile it automatically searched for papers that had my name in it. So these popped up automatically to me, and I had to say, Yes, that's mine or no, it's not

81
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.480
Logan Pearce (she/her): when I made my profile.

82
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:43.530
Logan Pearce (she/her): I've done so much good work.

83
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:44.850
Logan Pearce (she/her): not

84
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:51.910
Logan Pearce (she/her): most of these are. I did not write myself. Most of these are like small contributions t0 0ther People's papers

85
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:57.050
Logan Pearce (she/her): like this: One is a

86
00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.640
Logan Pearce (she/her): This one's first author I have

87
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.570
Logan Pearce (she/her): for almost 5. First off the papers. Here's the first author. Paper.

88
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.850
There's more. But yeah, here's another one

89
00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:20.610
fioravanti: I got at 4, almost 5 working on the fifth one.

90
00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:24.830
Logan Pearce (she/her): I just resubmitted it to be like No, it shouldn't be rejected.

91
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.040
fioravanti: That's you know, People don't realize that that actually does work sometimes.

92
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.960
fioravanti: Well, yeah, we have a strong case for why it should be

93
00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.880
Logan Pearce (she/her): Well, anyway, that's Google Scholar. Okay.

94
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:43.120
Logan Pearce (she/her): I think it's. So you can make your own library, which is really cool.

95
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:47.730
Logan Pearce (she/her): You can export your citations.

96
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:56.760
Logan Pearce (she/her): or you can just see if I just clicked on the site button, and it gave me citations in all these different formats. So if you need Mla

97
00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.830
Logan Pearce (she/her): or Apa. or whatever

98
00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.360
it's right there, which is great.

99
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.260
Logan Pearce (she/her): so you can just copy paste.

100
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:15.880
Logan Pearce (she/her): and then make a profile and link to it from your website, or your Cv. Or

101
00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:21.310
Logan Pearce (she/her): your Twitter, or whatever you use to like. Advertise yourself as an academic

102
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.270
Logan Pearce (she/her): like to your profile.

103
00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.600
Logan Pearce (she/her): so people can find you.

104
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.380
Okay?

105
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.820
Logan Pearce (she/her): Oh, I forgot about another tool. I forgot about Mark, Id.

106
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.190
Logan Pearce (she/her): anyway. for kid.

107
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:49.090
Logan Pearce (she/her): So Zotero is a paper or a citation management system.

108
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:56.280
Logan Pearce (she/her): There are other ones that are similar. There's mentally which is run by elsewhere.

109
00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.440
fioravanti: Yes.

110
00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:01.480
Logan Pearce (she/her): and then there's papers which cost money

111
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:11.520
Logan Pearce (she/her): so middle and so Terra. Both have free versions. Papers does not have a free version. There's one called Papership. I think that's an ipad app.

112
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:34.530
Logan Pearce (she/her): So this is all of my papers that I've wanted to save for some reason.

113
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.490
Logan Pearce (she/her): and I have him ordered by author, because usually

114
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:46.280
Logan Pearce (she/her): I want to look you. Usually things are referenced by first authors name, so I, that's usually how I want to find things.

115
00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:57.440
Logan Pearce (she/her): and so if I have a paper that I want to see, I can just double click on it. and it pops up in a pdf

116
00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:01.740
Logan Pearce (she/her): in the within this Ottero app.

117
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.130
Logan Pearce (she/her): and I can read it

118
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:08.400
Logan Pearce (she/her): and see everything I need to see. I can also highlight things

119
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:12.820
Logan Pearce (she/her): and and make comments. If I want.

120
00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:27.420
Logan Pearce (she/her): I don't need this, though, so I delete it. and it's so. Taro syncs to the cloud so I can access so taro from a browser. I can access my zotero library from a browser, or from a

121
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.190
Logan Pearce (she/her): from another device.

122
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.670
and all of my annotations and stuff will will come with it.

123
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:44.480
Logan Pearce (she/her): You can also, but it also downloads a local copy. So if I right click on this, I can say

124
00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.580
Logan Pearce (she/her): show file, and it will show me

125
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:53.400
Logan Pearce (she/her): the the Pdf. And I can like, if I need to like, send it to somebody or something

126
00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:54.750
fioravanti: that's great.

127
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:58.380
I can send that up the Pdf. To a friend or something.

128
00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:06.380
fioravanti: My question is the thing that a lot of my students

129
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:12.920
fioravanti: we're asking about was like, Does it generate a bibliography?

130
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:24.520
Logan Pearce (she/her): So I also made all these folders to to categorize things, and all I have to do is like drag and drop.

131
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:38.280
Logan Pearce (she/her): I could just drag from my library and drop it int0 0ne of the folders. I'm not gonna do that because I don't want them in there. But then I can look at. So if I want to see back to pulled it in white dwarfs. I want to see all my polluted white door papers.

132
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:39.780
Logan Pearce (she/her): I have them all

133
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:41.900
in this little folder.

134
00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:48.540
Logan Pearce (she/her): and I, you know I I made you. Oh, and you can also drag

135
00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:58.040
Logan Pearce (she/her): then into multiple folders. So if one paper addresses multiple different topics that I I wanted to categorize it as I can drop.

136
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.800
Logan Pearce (she/her): I can drag and drop them into multiple folders.

137
00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.140
Logan Pearce (she/her): and

138
00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.980
Logan Pearce (she/her): and they also have a browser

139
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:23.680
Logan Pearce (she/her): plug in. So if I go back to here, where I was looking at this paper. If I want to add this paper

140
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:27.480
Logan Pearce (she/her): to my zotero, I can just click on the

141
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.760
Logan Pearce (she/her): the save to zotero browser

142
00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:33.360
Logan Pearce (she/her): plug in

143
00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:46.420
Logan Pearce (she/her): so it I it's saving in my polluted white doors folder. I can pick which one I want, but this is a

144
00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:51.730
Logan Pearce (she/her): there it is there? It is right there, there's the paper. I saved it.

145
00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.080
fioravanti: Wow!

146
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:56.740
Logan Pearce (she/her): You can. Why is this Here, Go, stop, stop.

147
00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:58.500
Logan Pearce (she/her): go away!

148
00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:01.790
Logan Pearce (she/her): Okay.

149
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:06.430
fioravanti: But now you need a robot to tell you. Go back and read. Now.

150
00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.430
Logan Pearce (she/her): Well, do you see that I have this to read? Folder.

151
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.200
fioravanti: Yeah, I I noticed that

152
00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:15.050
Logan Pearce (she/her): that that's way out of date. I can't even do that.

153
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:28.960
Logan Pearce (she/her): And then okay, and then you can also for each of these collections you can creative bibliography.

154
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:38.380
Logan Pearce (she/her): That's what I want to know create a bibliography. It asks you for the file type or the type.

155
00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:42.830
Logan Pearce (she/her): so I don't.

156
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:49.230
fioravanti: I don't know which one I don't use this. I don't use good luck fees this way. But

157
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.810
Logan Pearce (she/her): is that this one

158
00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:56.490
fioravanti: that'll be good? Chicago's good.

159
00:14:56.590 --> 00:15:09.310
Logan Pearce (she/her): Okay. Is that what Apa stands for? You learn something every day. Yeah. And so then you can export. So I've I've exported. So with this I've I've exported all of the

160
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:16.080
Logan Pearce (she/her): ones that I am in that that are in that folder. So it's not my whole library. It's just the ones I put in that folder.

161
00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:17.810
fioravanti: Okay.

162
00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:19.440
Logan Pearce (she/her): you can also

163
00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:21.850
Logan Pearce (she/her): do.

164
00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:36.120
fioravanti: But can you control it? Okay, Can you go into that folder and just select and then create a bibliography like, so you have so many different texts in there. Yeah. So if I do, if I just pick on one, I can, I can create a bit like a fee for one item.

165
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.580
fioravanti: right? Right? That's that's so great. Yeah.

166
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:50.290
Logan Pearce (she/her): And if you use Latex, I use Latex for writing, and if you don't know what that is, Don't worry about it.

167
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:57.100
Logan Pearce (she/her): which a lot of physical sciences do you can also use. You can also generate your vib tech file from this, too.

168
00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:00.460
Logan Pearce (she/her): So

169
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:04.100
Logan Pearce (she/her): okay. oh.

170
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:09.840
Logan Pearce (she/her): more about. So Taro. They also just came out with a

171
00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:13.990
with an ipad app.

172
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.060
Logan Pearce (she/her): Show that.

173
00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:36.840
Logan Pearce (she/her): hey? So they also have an ipad app. So in my I can click on my zotero ipad app. and all of my stuff is here. So if I go to the included white dwarfs.

174
00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:46.090
Logan Pearce (she/her): I can, if I want to read a paper. it downloads from the cloud. Open the paper I can

175
00:16:47.240 --> 00:17:00.230
Logan Pearce (she/her): draw on it. I can highlight things. etc., on my ipad. and then that will sync to my computer and i'll be able to see my annotations on the computer.

176
00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.120
Right?

177
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:04.550
fioravanti: So another question is

178
00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:13.460
fioravanti: when you're when you're at. So these are all articles. Most of these are articles. So say you're entering a book, right? So the question is, you know

179
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:20.030
fioravanti: I I may not have the right addition. I may just see, like a citation somewhere.

180
00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:30.790
It may be like such a popular book. It has like tons of versions and addition. So how do you pull down a book citation. It does not like. What's your practice for that?

181
00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:32.980
Logan Pearce (she/her): Oh, I don't. Hello!

182
00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:36.060
Logan Pearce (she/her): I don't. I don't deal with that

183
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:50.710
Logan Pearce (she/her): so I can. That's a bad time.

184
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:56.520
fioravanti: this phone call I've been waiting for all day, and it's putting in now.

185
00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:00.980
Logan Pearce (she/her): Hi relyn no worries

186
00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:10.440
Logan Pearce (she/her): I, and just going through, since since nobody else was here. I was just been talking with Fiore about

187
00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:20.730
Logan Pearce (she/her): the tools that I use, and i'm recording it so that it will be available to members. Yeah, so please feel free to jump in with questions

188
00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:25.470
Logan Pearce (she/her): or comments, or thoughts, or whatever on whatever we're going over.

189
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:39.800
Logan Pearce (she/her): I help make it. What's what's your background, Logan. So i'm an astronomer.

190
00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:56.060
Logan Pearce (she/her): Physical sciences side of it, and Fiore is coming from our humanities. Guy: yeah. So we have. You know, the disciplines have very different norms. And so we have very different

191
00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:15.900
Roslyn Grizzard: takes on on on this. So it's good to get both. It's really weird, because I am probably one of those people that use both sides of that.

192
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:33.630
Roslyn Grizzard: Yeah, but I love literature, and I love all the humanity stuff. And so sometimes that's just like crazy. So so that's what I did in the Navy. I was the nuclear officer. Okay, cool. Yeah.

193
00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:49.950
Roslyn Grizzard: Crafts. I got out of 94. And so they were just putting them now, then, on aircraft carriers, Gotcha! I got out right before they put women on submarines, so so there are women on submarines right now. Last I heard there were officers, but not enlisted.

194
00:19:49.950 --> 00:20:14.470
Logan Pearce (she/her): I can't imagine them retrofitting or trying to fit Well, Exactly so. That's why they do did it with officers, because you can. They have their state rooms. They can just have a couple of people. So my the first ship I was on was a forget, and they actually had the same thing. We we didn't have any enlisted women, because it was too small to like retrofit like huge birthings for like 100.

195
00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:16.280
fioravanti: Wow.

196
00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.280
anyway.

197
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:27.380
Logan Pearce (she/her): So that's why I love Zotero. It's the best.

198
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.790
Logan Pearce (she/her): I also have. Share my screen again.

199
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:34.180
I also have

200
00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.940
Logan Pearce (she/her): my digitized notes in here from

201
00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:40.030
classes like

202
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.040
Logan Pearce (she/her): like this is notes that I took in class.

203
00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:50.750
Logan Pearce (she/her): I just took pictures or I scanned it. Sorry when I scanned it with an ipad. Iphone scan app

204
00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.310
fioravanti: yeah

205
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:57.710
Logan Pearce (she/her): to digitize my notes, and so I have those in here, so I can access them from everywhere.

206
00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:01.420
fioravanti: I have people's slides like

207
00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:06.330
Logan Pearce (she/her): Here's some slides on stuff I needed to know, you know.

208
00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:10.470
Logan Pearce (she/her): so

209
00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.420
Logan Pearce (she/her): you can also save snapshots of web pages.

210
00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:21.530
Logan Pearce (she/her): So I, for example, if I go down here.

211
00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:29.250
Logan Pearce (she/her): I like, here's some things that I needed that were quick references so like

212
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.800
Logan Pearce (she/her): that did not open up the shared screen.

213
00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:40.250
Logan Pearce (she/her): So this is so. I saved a snapshot of this web page if I needed to look up this information again

214
00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:50.670
Logan Pearce (she/her): on this star. This is stuff about a star, so I saved like this. And now I have a local copy of this website. So if I needed to look up the Age of the Star

215
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.890
Logan Pearce (she/her): like, I could just get it real quickly, because it's right here, and I wouldn't have to go back and search for it again.

216
00:21:56.530 --> 00:22:03.380
fioravanti: But when you take a snapshot the the the URL is not active anymore there, or is it

217
00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:14.660
Logan Pearce (she/her): okay?

218
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:17.140
Logan Pearce (she/her): It's opening up in the in a different window.

219
00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:20.710
Logan Pearce (she/her): That's why it's a local file.

220
00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:30.690
Logan Pearce (she/her): But if this is like this is like some reference information that I would.

221
00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:36.170
Logan Pearce (she/her): So, for example.

222
00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:43.570
Logan Pearce (she/her): just go to this website. and with the connector, the browser connector.

223
00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:52.170
Logan Pearce (she/her): we'll save save a snapshot of

224
00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.760
Logan Pearce (she/her): go to a website.

225
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:58.860
Logan Pearce (she/her): This browser connector will save

226
00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.510
Logan Pearce (she/her): a snapshot of the of the

227
00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.160
fioravanti: website.

228
00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.910
fioravanti: It only take me 5 min.

229
00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:20.490
Roslyn Grizzard: Is that okay? Yes, you have. You have.

230
00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:50.530
fioravanti: and I and I typed in it. But I I do. I have a very simple C to show you. I basically like when I do research, or when I encourage my students or clients to do research.

231
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:54.380
fioravanti: I I try to think of it in terms of

232
00:23:54.420 --> 00:24:08.190
fioravanti: you know, 3 categories. So I have pure semi- pure and very impure. So, so, for example, if I show you here on the share screen, I think I could share. Right.

233
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.680
fioravanti: Yeah. Am I allowed to share

234
00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:19.550
fioravanti: open system, pre open system, preferences, security and privacy? Okay.

235
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:22.430
Logan Pearce (she/her): I have a new

236
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.940
fioravanti: Yeah.

237
00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.160
fioravanti: See if I can find it

238
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:34.930
Roslyn Grizzard: kind of with you. You're I. I've noticed whenever I have to do writing

239
00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:45.980
Roslyn Grizzard: I prefer hand. I I any day I pre I don't know how this younger generation just tears away on their computer. I can't. I can't do it. It's not comfortable.

240
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:52.600
Roslyn Grizzard: I can never get in the correct position to right. I can never. It's just this whole

241
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.330
Roslyn Grizzard: thing.

242
00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:59.050
Logan Pearce (she/her): Well, and in my discipline we actually use Latex, which is

243
00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:06.860
Logan Pearce (she/her): like a type setting language. So it's like.

244
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:14.170
Logan Pearce (she/her): and I can show you my late tech, but it it kind of looks almost like code.

245
00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:18.940
Logan Pearce (she/her): Okay, in addition to writing. But it's for generating like it's a type setting

246
00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:20.330
Logan Pearce (she/her): language.

247
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:26.400
Roslyn Grizzard: Wait, I have to leave in order to in order to share. So i'm gonna leave and come back.

248
00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.620
Roslyn Grizzard: Yeah, so

249
00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:33.600
Logan Pearce (she/her): i'll just

250
00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.990
Logan Pearce (she/her): to show you what late tech looks like.

251
00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.710
Logan Pearce (she/her): So this is over leaf. It's like Google Docs for

252
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:46.680
Logan Pearce (she/her): for late. And so here's my paper that i'm

253
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:47.870
Logan Pearce (she/her): just submitted.

254
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:51.420
Logan Pearce (she/her): But yeah, it looks like this. So it's like

255
00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.100
Logan Pearce (she/her): I'm showing up late tech now.

256
00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:04.420
Logan Pearce (she/her): But yeah, it's a

257
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:11.690
Logan Pearce (she/her): typesetting language. So yeah, here's so. Here's the

258
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:20.210
Logan Pearce (she/her): it has red because that I just submitted this, and I had to make changes. So.

259
00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:37.320
for example.

260
00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:41.580
Logan Pearce (she/her): if you just look at citations, so you have this thing called v tech.

261
00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:43.180
Logan Pearce (she/her): which is

262
00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:55.220
Logan Pearce (she/her): the language for bibliographies or for citations. So this all this information is under this tag. This is the tag. So when I cite it in the text.

263
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:59.210
Logan Pearce (she/her): I just say, site the tag.

264
00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:03.320
Logan Pearce (she/her): and then it generates the in-text citation correctly.

265
00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:09.360
Logan Pearce (she/her): which is all this blue text is the in-text citation, and it automatically generates

266
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:14.050
Roslyn Grizzard: the bibliography, too. So do you have to take a class to learn that

267
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:20.900
Logan Pearce (she/her): I got introduced to it in a class

268
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:29.400
Logan Pearce (she/her): like forced myself to learn it. I just

269
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:48.080
Logan Pearce (she/her): you can also set. You can also tag figures and tables. So if I so like I've tagged this section, I've given it this label. So if I need to say section whatever later, I just call this tag, I don't have to keep track of like figure, which is, figure one and figure 2. And

270
00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:56.050
Logan Pearce (she/her): is it the right order? And if I change the order, it updates that automatically.

271
00:27:56.270 --> 00:28:02.590
Logan Pearce (she/her): This is standard in my field. Everyone in my Field uses latex to write papers.

272
00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:06.160
Logan Pearce (she/her): you know a lot. I a lot of other fields. Yeah.

273
00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:11.010
Logan Pearce (she/her): like I have a friend who is a geologist, and they write everything in in word. So

274
00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:11.990
Roslyn Grizzard: right.

275
00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:16.350
Logan Pearce (she/her): yeah, it just depends your it depends on what's like the norm in your field.

276
00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.770
fioravanti: Well, i'll show I'll show you guys just a little bit.

277
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:31.060
fioravanti: My daughters are calling me to They They never cook, so that the one time they cook I have to go and eat the terrible food.

278
00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:37.670
fioravanti: But they, you know I've I've I've I've I've I've I've teenaged girls with trying to get them to cook.

279
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:44.760
fioravanti: So we we they once in a while that makes something you can actually eat. And and i'm like this is what happens.

280
00:28:44.850 --> 00:29:04.590
fioravanti: Cool, all right. So what do you concept of food is different than the food itself. So, anyway, so in the humanities, you know, I I used to do very highly detailed research into critical theory, and you know it has to be all peer-reviewed and stuff.

281
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:06.250
but I discovered that

282
00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:23.690
fioravanti: it's good to make 3 different categories for me databases that are only peer reviewed and databases that mix and database is that ultra mix, and i'll show you why I mean they they're very. It's very, very simple. It's a very simple system, I still use it.

283
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:26.570
You know a lot of my clients use it too. So

284
00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:44.540
fioravanti: if if you're in a specific field, then it's much easier. So like in if i'm if i'm working with a client who's in in business studies, there, are you the database for the field is usually the best database right. So here, for example, this is a very expensive database. I can. I can't find it anywhere except

285
00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:45.560
here.

286
00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:50.370
fioravanti: and it's called Business source complete, and the quality of the results is so high.

287
00:29:50.450 --> 00:30:03.190
fioravanti: So there's one for business, majors. You. You show me one for astronomy, which is great, but say, I don't know, so I don't have an amazing database. So when I go to my library site.

288
00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:09.410
fioravanti: the the the the one database that's the cleanest, you know, is J. Store.

289
00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:29.240
fioravanti: so J. Still will get you only high quality peer-reviewed journals in almost all the humanities history, all the way. Through. And so you're accessing this through your Universities Library.

290
00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.540
Logan Pearce (she/her): The ability to search all of

291
00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:37.690
Logan Pearce (she/her): the peer-reviewed stuff, too.

292
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.010
Logan Pearce (she/her): Things like viewing minras articles or

293
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:57.020
Logan Pearce (she/her): minresses. Article in a journal in my Field viewing journals that have paywalls. If I do that from my university Wi-fi, I can access it just fine, because they have

294
00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:11.000
Logan Pearce (she/her): the university pays for it. But if i'm at home like I am right now. I often can't access it because it costs money. So yeah, anyway, i'll have to say, just go through your library and your university's resources to access things that are not free.

295
00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:21.350
Roslyn Grizzard: If you're actively working like I am in health care. Oh, usually I have to go to get around those pay walls. My institutional facility usually has

296
00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:27.700
Roslyn Grizzard: those memberships, I guess. because publications

297
00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:28.950
cool

298
00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:49.740
very. it will spit out things that

299
00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:50.910
fioravanti: are

300
00:31:51.210 --> 00:32:03.620
fioravanti: all the same genre, but a very, very different quality. And so it's up to you as a researcher and as a person in your being deep in your field, you start to understand which is good quality which is not good quality. So the way I get around that

301
00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:23.670
fioravanti: is, I do. I have like these 3 categories. So the pure, impure, and dirty right so, and I kind of, and I kind of use them against each other. So I I usually don't start with the purest one. I don't start with Jay, so I start with one. That's a mix. So this one here is called academic, one file, which is in almost every university.

302
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:32.310
fioravanti: and it'll give you like a mix of kind of newspapers and and articles. and that's good, because science, when you're so just starting research

303
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:48.850
fioravanti: you want to make like very high ends, material with kind of like a little newspaper review. Just kind of get a feeling in general of the topic.

304
00:32:49.040 --> 00:33:00.840
fioravanti: The Jason Store and Jason will give me a high quality peer review, like almost every single thing like i'm doing research now on Frankenstein and science. So if I put Frankenstein in here

305
00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:02.510
i'll get.

306
00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:19.040
fioravanti: I'll get only very high quality articles. I don't even have to think about it, because that's the problem with Google Scholar for me. Is that

307
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:26.920
fioravanti: then I go to a very impure source.

308
00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:39.310
fioravanti: your graphical source. So this is just every single book published in the field, right? So i'll. I'll go to that, or I'll even go to Google, not Google Scholar, but Google, because then it'll mix it up

309
00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:48.610
fioravanti: so much that it. It. It kind of refreshes me right, so I like to start with the one that mixes it a little, this one academic one file.

310
00:33:48.800 --> 00:34:01.690
fioravanti: and then I move up to J Store, and then if I freak out and I don't have enough, then I go just all the way down to like, you know, mixing with the you know, the unwashed masses and do Google just out right. Google. It's a it's just a very simple system.

311
00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:12.510
fioravanti: And then you could lays of terror on top of that

312
00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:26.300
fioravanti: my main problem is finding quality, cause it's so hard to find quality. Because I work for young People. I work with a lot of teenagers, and you have to find really high quality texts like they can tell immediately if your text sucks.

313
00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:41.210
fioravanti: even if it sucks a little bit. They know it immediately.

314
00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:45.300
Roslyn Grizzard: Nice guys are bringing up something pretty interesting because I saw

315
00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:58.010
Roslyn Grizzard: a tick talk last week from a physician, and they were talking about the what is it? Chat, chat?

316
00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:05.710
Roslyn Grizzard: The guy was saying that the references that we're being pulled into this? You know one citation

317
00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:13.030
Roslyn Grizzard: while it looks valid, you know it was. It was just a bunch of garbage.

318
00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:24.560
Logan Pearce (she/her): Well, so here that that leads nicely into another tool. I was gonna share, which is called Research Rabbit or

319
00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:30.100
Logan Pearce (she/her): So Research Rabbit. Here's this risk Research rabbit.

320
00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:33.600
So i'll go ahead and log in, so I can show you mine.

321
00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:38.440
Logan Pearce (she/her): and you can import your zotero.

322
00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:40.640
fioravanti: I can also Tara.

323
00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:49.950
Logan Pearce (she/her): and you can. So it's. So I I've imported my zotero. So here's all of my papers that are in my Zotero library.

324
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:59.010
Logan Pearce (she/her): and if I pick one paper I can see the connections. It shows me connections t0 0ther papers.

325
00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:02.120
Logan Pearce (she/her): So which one did. I pick

326
00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:18.040
Logan Pearce (she/her): 1 1998. So that's the paper that I picked, and so I can see other papers that are connected to it in some way. So if I pick like this type 2013 is a big big connection, so I can see the

327
00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:29.550
Logan Pearce (she/her): abstract and titles and stuff, and see if it's relevant, you know, and then that connects to this hammer's 2928, and I can see what's up with that one.

328
00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:35.950
Logan Pearce (she/her): and connected papers does something similar. But this is a way to find

329
00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.370
Logan Pearce (she/her): some papers. This is the way to find

330
00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:47.700
Logan Pearce (she/her): find new papers, because we were talking about. What did I use for My!

331
00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:58.030
Logan Pearce (she/her): So this is the way to find new papers.

332
00:36:58.870 --> 00:37:05.240
Logan Pearce (she/her): So i'm on connect to papers. Now, if I this is not, have this Ontario connection. But let's say I put in

333
00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:08.890
Logan Pearce (she/her): the title of one of my papers. Where's night.

334
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:11.280
Logan Pearce (she/her): Tara?

335
00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.620
Let me pick a paper.

336
00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.540
Logan Pearce (she/her): Sure fine

337
00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:17.930
Logan Pearce (she/her): copy.

338
00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:19.770
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yes.

339
00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:26.500
Logan Pearce (she/her): and then it will generate a

340
00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:29.220
Logan Pearce (she/her): graph, showing

341
00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:33.350
Logan Pearce (she/her): eventually

342
00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:40.020
Logan Pearce (she/her): showing other papers that connect to this paper

343
00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:50.220
Logan Pearce (she/her): find literature that's related to what you're doing. So this one paper connects to this one. I can see the title and the abstract

344
00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:52.340
Logan Pearce (she/her): connects to.

345
00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:54.180
So let's see here

346
00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:57.250
that's actually a book.

347
00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:00.400
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah, stuff like that. So

348
00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:10.710
Logan Pearce (she/her): if you're like trying to learn something, learn, you know. Find your papers, learn, learn something new like, get involved in, you know. Dig into a new topic or something.

349
00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:14.820
Logan Pearce (she/her): This is a way to easily find

350
00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:19.610
Logan Pearce (she/her): other relevant papers to whatever you're working on.

351
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:24.350
fioravanti: That's cool.

352
00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:29.590
Logan Pearce (she/her): but I can turn it off now. They don't have snowflakes on them. I don't know silly.

353
00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:38.190
Logan Pearce (she/her): But yeah. So that's another really great tool

354
00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:40.790
Logan Pearce (she/her): for finding papers.

355
00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:50.860
Roslyn Grizzard: Probably gonna use that tonight. Awesome and research rabbit like I said connects to my zotero. So I can do it

356
00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.620
Logan Pearce (she/her): through

357
00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:59.870
Logan Pearce (she/her): through my library that I've already built.

358
00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:05.050
Logan Pearce (she/her): and you can generate citations and stuff just like you can through so taro

359
00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:06.670
fioravanti: beautiful.

360
00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:21.220
Logan Pearce (she/her): Well, i'm heading out to dinner.

361
00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:46.610
Logan Pearce (she/her): I follow following academics and academics that have like they'll often have like

362
00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:06.460
fioravanti: alright, guys good.

363
00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.800
Logan Pearce (she/her): So the last like, really?

364
00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.800
Logan Pearce (she/her): Well, I don't know I was also going to talk about archive.

365
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:19.680
Logan Pearce (she/her): So archive is a pre-print service so

366
00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:23.470
Logan Pearce (she/her): this particular version, is only for like

367
00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:29.780
Logan Pearce (she/her): physics, math, astronomy. statistics, economics so. But

368
00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:39.460
Logan Pearce (she/her): whatever your field is, there's probably some kind of pre print service for for articles in your field. I don't. I don't know what it is, but this is the one that I use.

369
00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.720
Logan Pearce (she/her): So

370
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:45.170
Logan Pearce (she/her): it a pre print service, just like

371
00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:47.640
Logan Pearce (she/her): let's people post

372
00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:55.950
Logan Pearce (she/her): versions of their paper before they are published in the journals

373
00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:00.870
Logan Pearce (she/her): current. It's kind of like a feed of current papers.

374
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:11.910
Logan Pearce (she/her): So like I just clicked on Earth and planetary actually, because that's one of the one of those subjects that I follow on. Okay. And so these are all the papers that were posted

375
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:12.840
Logan Pearce (she/her): today.

376
00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:19.760
Logan Pearce (she/her): Or yeah, that's today in under this field under this subject, so

377
00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:21.660
Logan Pearce (she/her): like I can see

378
00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:38.390
Logan Pearce (she/her): the newest things that have just come out or are coming out. This is a pre print, so it's before they're like published. Published. Usually people post it once it's been accepted to a journal, but before it's been published in the journal.

379
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:41.950
so that they can solicit feedback from the community

380
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:56.850
Logan Pearce (she/her): before it gets accepted. But so, for example, this is actually a paper i'm interested in. This is actually relevant to me. Actually know these people, but so I can see a Pdf. Of the paper. I can read it. I can read the abstract.

381
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:03.540
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah. So I can see the the paper, read it

382
00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:11.620
Logan Pearce (she/her): and the abstract, and then this one has been submitted. It has not been accepted to the journal.

383
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.650
Logan Pearce (she/her): But this is a good.

384
00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:19.910
Logan Pearce (she/her): This is actually an interesting paper that I need to read. But

385
00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:28.660
Logan Pearce (she/her): and I can also like, see it on Google Scholar. I can see it on ads, which is the service that I use instead of Google Solar. I can see the citation. I can get all that stuff.

386
00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.220
Logan Pearce (she/her): this

387
00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:38.680
Logan Pearce (she/her): all this also you could also sign up for digest emails. So every night at like

388
00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:50.030
Logan Pearce (she/her): 9 Pm. I get an email of tomorrow's papers

389
00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:56.830
Logan Pearce (she/her): through the digest email to see if anything is interesting, and I wanted to read more about. So

390
00:42:57.070 --> 00:43:14.210
Logan Pearce (she/her): I understand that this is an archive is not relevant to most people. But whatever field you're in, I bet there's some kind of pre print service like this.

391
00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:25.540
Roslyn Grizzard: But this is kind of the way to like. Stay on top of the latest. I like that. I used to always complain because I felt like some of my radiologists.

392
00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:30.970
Roslyn Grizzard: I like to read white papers. I like to know what was going on in my field, and

393
00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:35.620
Roslyn Grizzard: I would go, and I would talk to them, and they would like be like what?

394
00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:50.980
Roslyn Grizzard: S0 0bviously to me they were probably people who were subscribing to that. But I I was like what's the newest? Not necessarily the newest, but the most relevant. And you know what's going on right now, so

395
00:43:50.990 --> 00:44:02.940
Logan Pearce (she/her): you could, probably I'm sure. There's a way through Google Scholar to sign up for alerts and stuff, too. I didn't even know about Google Scholar. That was what I talked about before you arrived.

396
00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:10.260
Logan Pearce (she/her): So yeah, I'm going to post the video to the the classroom, so you can check that out.

397
00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:17.980
Logan Pearce (she/her): But Google scholars like a way to search papers and stuff. and i'm sure that there's a way that's

398
00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:23.960
Roslyn Grizzard: a way to set up like a Google alert like you can for search terms.

399
00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:30.470
Logan Pearce (she/her): The last thing I was gonna show is my favorite way to take notes, which is.

400
00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:48.050
Logan Pearce (she/her): I didn't do this early in my in my time. I used paper notes because I also like paper notes, but now I have an ipad and an apple pencil.

401
00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:53.000
Logan Pearce (she/her): because I can do it through my.

402
00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:58.980
Logan Pearce (she/her): there we go. So my good notes.

403
00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:07.690
Logan Pearce (she/her): So it's just like digital notes that I can mark on with my my pencil. So

404
00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:11.000
Logan Pearce (she/her): let me go to my research

405
00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:14.450
Logan Pearce (she/her): and let's do the white doors. Why not?

406
00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:19.260
Logan Pearce (she/her): So I've been reading a whole bunch of papers on White Door pollution.

407
00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:22.090
Logan Pearce (she/her): So here it is.

408
00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:28.440
Logan Pearce (she/her): So you know you have, like all these.

409
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:33.070
Logan Pearce (she/her): you know, tools for writing, and different colors and highlighting, and all that stuff.

410
00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:34.730
Logan Pearce (she/her): and the racing.

411
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:39.020
Logan Pearce (she/her): and it's searchable. It searches your handwriting

412
00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:42.110
Logan Pearce (she/her): so I can search.

413
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:48.830
Logan Pearce (she/her): What is it? Search? So if I want to search for?

414
00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:59.690
Logan Pearce (she/her): So it found like it found this

415
00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.030
oops stuff.

416
00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:06.370
Logan Pearce (she/her): It sounds that this is the word companion.

417
00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:15.370
Roslyn Grizzard: Oh, well, it and that's good notes with, yeah.

418
00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:20.300
Logan Pearce (she/her): And I like you can see that I have like.

419
00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:26.720
Logan Pearce (she/her): like this plot. Here. I screenshoted it on my

420
00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:35.470
Logan Pearce (she/her): macbook, and I air dropped it to my ipad so I can put it right in there, and then I could draw on it, as you can see I did here. I drew on it

421
00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.290
Logan Pearce (she/her): so.

422
00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:40.310
Logan Pearce (she/her): and then finally

423
00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.360
Logan Pearce (she/her): you can

424
00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:49.260
Logan Pearce (she/her): export it 2. Wait for it.

425
00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.120
Logan Pearce (she/her): export it to Zotero.

426
00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:00.610
Logan Pearce (she/her): It takes a long time. This is actually a big exile.

427
00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:03.690
Logan Pearce (she/her): Let me do a less big one.

428
00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:04.990
a small

429
00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:07.570
anything.

430
00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:13.530
Logan Pearce (she/her): Okay? So I can export it 2.

431
00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:16.660
Logan Pearce (she/her): So Tara

432
00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:21.830
Logan Pearce (she/her): and I'm going to put it in my good notes, notebooks.

433
00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:29.530
Logan Pearce (she/her): And now I have it accessible in my so taro

434
00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:32.680
Logan Pearce (she/her): on my computer.

435
00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:39.490
Roslyn Grizzard: That's cool, which then allows you to pull it up and all your other.

436
00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:43.290
Logan Pearce (she/her): And this is the one I just said just now.

437
00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:47.570
Roslyn Grizzard: Oh, that no, that's not it. It was this one.

438
00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.890
Logan Pearce (she/her): because I just said it today.

439
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:55.140
Roslyn Grizzard: Okay, yeah.

440
00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:56.860
Logan Pearce (she/her): And now I have my

441
00:47:58.030 --> 00:48:03.010
Logan Pearce (she/her): my good notes handwriting in

442
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:12.310
Logan Pearce (she/her): in my So Taro and I can access it from any computer anywhere. and it's on the cloud.

443
00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:15.990
Roslyn Grizzard: It makes it really seamless. I like that.

444
00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:22.360
Logan Pearce (she/her): I also got a planner on zoom because I like my Google

445
00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:27.480
Logan Pearce (she/her): Calendar, but I also like writing on a planner.

446
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:44.710
Roslyn Grizzard: and it can. It can connect to my Google Calendar.

447
00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:59.580
Roslyn Grizzard: I didn't even know good notes had the plan or hang on. Yeah, I I had to pay for the one that connects to my Google. But it was like 15 Bucks.

448
00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:02.170
Logan Pearce (she/her): Barnes and Noble. It would be that much, you know.

449
00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:04.400
Roslyn Grizzard: Yeah, here's my planner.

450
00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:08.870
Logan Pearce (she/her): and then this is where I keep track of the papers to read. Now

451
00:49:09.350 --> 00:49:12.620
Logan Pearce (she/her): these are my papers to read.

452
00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:25.910
Logan Pearce (she/her): but it this this particular one that I bought has like a little. It has this little clock icon right here. and then it loads up my Google Calendar.

453
00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:31.040
Logan Pearce (she/her): And I can add things, and I can add things to my Google Calendar right from the planner.

454
00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:33.970
Roslyn Grizzard: It's pretty cool.

455
00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:34.710
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah.

456
00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:41.090
Logan Pearce (she/her): Anyway, those are just some of the productivity tools that I have

457
00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:47.550
Roslyn Grizzard: the I and you know what i'm actually been looking for, and I haven't been able to get any. I haven't been able to find one

458
00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:57.700
Roslyn Grizzard: so far is one that allows me to. I don't know if anybody in school is really tracking that. But how long I'm spending on a particular task

459
00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:17.670
Roslyn Grizzard: they really haven't worked. I've tried manual. I've tried, you know. tactile manual things that I could turn that Still Hasn't worked. So i'm still looking for a system. With that

460
00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:23.120
Logan Pearce (she/her): I I just really use my Google Calendar as a way to

461
00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:33.800
Logan Pearce (she/her): I don't tell myself to do things. But but yeah, I don't. I don't use that that myself.

462
00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:44.170
Roslyn Grizzard: Where you can get a focus. I'll let you focus for 30 min or 60 min, and that's something I knew I found out the other day which I didn't even know existed.

463
00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:46.930
Have you heard of Pomodoro?

464
00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:48.060
Roslyn Grizzard: I've not

465
00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:51.760
Logan Pearce (she/her): so. Let me find the pomodoro technique.

466
00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:56.410
Roslyn Grizzard: It's a productivity technique.

467
00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:04.550
Roslyn Grizzard: The guy who came up with it used a tomato timer

468
00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:06.450
Logan Pearce (she/her): tomatoes.

469
00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:10.200
But the idea with Pomodoro, is that you?

470
00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:21.650
Logan Pearce (she/her): Then you stop for 5 min. so in like, Get up and like leave. even if you're in the flow, you're still supposed to stop

471
00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:28.850
Logan Pearce (she/her): another 25 min. Stop for 5,

472
00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:33.840
Logan Pearce (she/her): and then I think you do that 3 times, and then you have, like a long break like a 30 min break or something.

473
00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:48.160
Logan Pearce (she/her): so it it lets you know you start, and then it counts down, and then it it plays like an alarm at 5 min.

474
00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:55.780
Roslyn Grizzard: or when it when it's done counting, and then it sets for it, it automatically does the short and long pauses.

475
00:51:56.290 --> 00:52:08.100
Logan Pearce (she/her): So I've used this before as a good way. Because, like. if you do one pomodoro, that's an hour and a half. If you d0 2, that's 3 h. you know, of productivity

476
00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:10.850
Roslyn Grizzard: like that. Yeah.

477
00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:18.530
Logan Pearce (she/her): So like. Sometimes I' in the past, like I'm going to do to Pomodora today on

478
00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:20.290
you know this this

479
00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:22.150
Logan Pearce (she/her): writing project, or whatever.

480
00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:28.540
Logan Pearce (she/her): and that gives you a nice goal, because it's like 20. It's only 25 min in a chunk.

481
00:52:29.290 --> 00:52:37.760
Logan Pearce (she/her): you know, and if you just be like. I gotta d0 3 0f them to like, complete my pomodor0 0r whatever That's an hour and a half.

482
00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:40.290
Roslyn Grizzard: Okay? And then you can

483
00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:44.810
Logan Pearce (she/her): go for a walk or something, you know, or you know, and then do a second pomodoro like

484
00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:50.110
Roslyn Grizzard: in the afternoon, you know, one in the morning, one of the afternoon I don't know.

485
00:52:50.770 --> 00:52:55.260
Roslyn Grizzard: especially if you have to write you want it? Yeah, I think that's a good. I i'll try this one.

486
00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:57.440
Logan Pearce (she/her): It's made for writing it's like

487
00:52:58.390 --> 00:53:02.440
Logan Pearce (she/her): designed to get writing tests accomplished

488
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:06.030
so highly recommend Pomodoro. That works really well.

489
00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:09.810
Roslyn Grizzard: cool. Thanks, Logan. Yeah.

490
00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:32.830
Logan Pearce (she/her): I don't think I have anything else. Do you have any other ideas? Questions?

491
00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:34.440
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah. And

492
00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:44.950
Logan Pearce (she/her): whatever your field will probably have, like you already said that we'll probably have, like a field specific way to search references like in astronomy. We have

493
00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:51.190
Logan Pearce (she/her): the NASA Ads system.

494
00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:58.180
Logan Pearce (she/her): So that's all I use. So like, whatever your feel will probably have something field specific.

495
00:53:58.500 --> 00:53:59.330
Roslyn Grizzard: Yeah.

496
00:53:59.390 --> 00:54:04.440
Logan Pearce (she/her): which is what you already mentioned to. So It's all about finding out what

497
00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:10.870
Roslyn Grizzard: that works for your for your sphere, of

498
00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:13.540
Logan Pearce (she/her): how people do it who are

499
00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:24.940
Logan Pearce (she/her): slightly ahead of you in in whatever program you're doing or something. Ask them how they how ask them how they do it. Okay, especially on the pre print service, and really think that that's valuable, and that

500
00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:26.530
Logan Pearce (she/her): there have to be.

501
00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:31.520
Logan Pearce (she/her): Yeah.

502
00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:37.900
Roslyn Grizzard: Well, thank you, ma'am. Yeah, Have a good night. Glad you showed up. Thank you. Bye.
